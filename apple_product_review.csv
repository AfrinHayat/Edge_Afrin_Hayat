"This laptop served me extremely well for more than six years. It is depandable and fun. Storage was the only downside - as a photographer, I struggled with the 512 GB that was available at the time.",2602860537,18536
The track pad for this machine is too smooth for me and gives my aging hands problems. And using the arrow keys to scroll doesn't work the same as my Chromebooks. I don't see where the Retina screen is in any way superior to my Toshiba HD Chromebooks.,2602850443,18536
"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.  THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!",2602761852,18535
all forms of establishing this computer to the correct running system et/al went smoothly except all the  passwords were defined in a not described format and the email program could not be connected as iCloud had my email buried within the demographics it contained. it took two hours with apple to be able to send emails as the computer did not allow my google email to connect . However it is a very beautiful computer...wow...what a ride and an amazing thing to experience the apple representative and how he went thru each and every system...very interesting.,2602738438,18535
"I've been using this computer for about 6 weeks now. Hopefully I don't jinx myself by posting this review, but so far I've not had any issues at all. The computer came in the original Apple packaging and was ready to use within minutes. There is a noticeable difference in the SSD performance which now comes standard instead of the older HDD. Load times are much faster and you don't get that clicking/whirring sound you'd get from an HDD. It's also incredibly light, so it's easy to take from room to room. Great battery life as well. I don't plan to run any heavy programs like Pro Tools or Final Cut on it, but for web browsing, spreadsheets, and streaming movies it has been excellent.",2602684185,18535
My son uses it for college,2602678435,18535
"So forget about all the other reviews. This is the skinny from a higher learning teacher: Is it fast? Yes. If you are browsing the web, watching videos, etc. It’s faster than my MSI with 16gb ram and RTX 2060 video card. Is it silent? YES. It’s the whole reason I bought it, so good for me. How is rendering audio or video? Good, BUT…My iMac 5k from 2017 with 4gb of video ram is faster with the few renderings I have done. The following is what surprised me (especially after reading all the fab reviews of battery): I put my Mac Air on sleep mode when I shut it down. Didn’t use it for a couple days, came back to get it and the battery was completely dead. Zero! I was VERY surprised.  I can always leave an MSI, Lenovo, HP, on sleep mode for a week or more. Those are the things I have experienced in my first week. Hope it helps.",2602600751,18535
"Super smooth performance, quiet fanless operation.Great deal!",2602585892,18535
I have had this computer for a while now and it has yet to let me down. I love it.I would recommend this as a college student.,2602548822,18535
"Amo todo lo que sea Apple y sinceramente no me decepcionó, súper slim, rápida, es como traer tu iphone en mano! Simplemente la amo!",2602529998,18535
"It's a mac. That's literally the only reason I bought it to customize an app that was iOS compatible only. Outside of that, the Camera is horrendous (its giving very 2011 photobooth camera quality) and if you have too many browsers or apps opens it practically crashes. Not really worth the prices in my opinion. Just pay the premium for a macbook pro if the camera and performance is a make or break for you.",2602486242,18535
Excellent value.,2602434234,18535
"I appreciate that the price was discounted for a great value.  The package was secure and well-packaged, which was very important, given that this was delivered via mail.  No cracks on the screen.  The processing speed is quick, which is extremely helpful!  I appreciate there were instructions, in a small pamphlet, that explained how to transfer everything from your previous MacBook to this MacBook.  A seamless transition is vital and means less frustration.  This MacBook Air is very user friendly, especially visually.  As someone who wears glasses, I appreciate the option to make the pointer larger, the ability to have more contrast, etc...  That the user manual automatically pops up and walks you through enhancements and new features makes this even more user-friendly.",2602427093,18535
"This Macbook is definitely great for users who want lots of power and versatility, but don't want to break the bank. It is very lightweight and sleek.The color (gold) is also very pretty, but keep in mind that it is more of a pinkish gold than a yellow gold. However, the camera quality is not great for such an otherwise powerful laptop. Especially in this era of zooming and FaceTiming, a good camera is essential in a laptop. It's not terrible, but its not great either. Another thing - the front lid of the MacBook got a couple of scratches very easily. I was able to get them off, but I would suggest getting a good quality case to ensure that this doesn't happen. All in all I would rate this Macbook a 4.5/5! Definitely lived up to the hype!",2602382610,18535
Rápida y comoda,2602351386,18535
Edit: didn’t return- it did offgass - needed to be cleaned withe alcohol based cleaner. multiple times and left out & open for 2 weeks before chem smells were gone.Just dont expect to be able to use it right out of box if you have MCS/TILTOriginal: Smells so badly I have to return it.,2602304053,18535
I needed to replace my 2015 MacBook Air since it was getting slow and I’m running low on storage.  It was an improvement but is not perfect.  Price wise it is an excellent buy and a lot cheaper than other Apple offerings.  I was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to transfer data and applications using time machine with Apple migration assistant.  The display is outstanding. What I don’t like is the lack of ports and no MagSafe connection for power.  And I prefer Catalina over Big Sur but maybe I’ll get used to it.  Also if you plan on keeping it for more than a couple of years and take a lot of pictures or movies 256 GB is not enough memory.  Get at least 512.,2602293760,18535
I had previously purchased a “renewed” MacBook Air and it wasn’t exactly what I would call renewed. I returned it and found a new MacBook Air for under $900. Only a few hundred more than someone else’s old one and I couldn’t be happier. I’ve had iPhones since 3GS and they have always been user friendly and the MacBook Air is just like my iPhone but better.I have always had windows and the last one installed the manufacturer update and afterwards I could not log into the computer. That’s the end of windows and the beginning of my Mac attack.I highly recommend this item especially if you are able to purchase it for under $900.,2602291642,18535
"Not much to say, excellent product overall. No cons except lack of ports. All day+ battery life, excellent screen. Keyboard is good as well. I have the 8 gb ram version but haven't seen any lag due to it. Use it often to run demanding simulations and it has not disappointed me so far.I was little concerned with the M1 chip and compatibility. However, x86-64 runs well enough, though CPU/ram usage is a bit higher (dropbox, for example). If you are using native versions, its far better than any x86-64 mobile cpus on market.",2605797274,18536
"Light, fast, and intuitive...happy with the product (disclosure: I'm an Apple fan)",2605784589,18536
"I just opened the outer box containing a Mac Air M1.  If you look at the picture, it will tell you why the Apple Store gets a 2 and I feel that is appropriate.  There is NO protection on one side and none on top or bottom.  When it was picked up off the porch, it bounced inside and you can figure that the USPS was not as careful as it was by any stretch of the imagination.  This is not a $10 item, it’s a highly rated Laptop.  Seriously folks???",2605769279,18536
"I purchased the MacBook Air to replace a 4th Gen Surface Pro that was down to about 30 minutes of battery life.  I purchased an Intel Mac Mini about six months ago and was intrigued by recent news articles regarding the M1 chip.  I'm thrilled with the added battery life on the new device and amazed by the speed difference between my Intel-based mini vs. the M1.  Out of the box, adding a full charge, the new Mac estimates 19+ hours of battery life.  I've been using the computer for three hours, four open apps, and have bumped the battery gauge to 98%.  Think I've eliminated battery anxiety.  App launches are two to three times faster on the Air vs. my Mini.  The new laptop is zippy!  I'm thrilled with my new laptop and look forward to many years together.",2605718918,18536
"If I could go back I probably would though past the time now.I'd say I'm computer savvy, spent years of time on windows programs, photoshop etc. Now that my current Dell Inspiron is reaching the end of its life, I followed all the great reviews and purchased this MacBook Air M1.Everything is hard. I actually loved my Dell in many ways, though hopefully its life, around 4-5 years, is about half what this Mac will be.Things I'm missing the most so far, a touch screen, the ability to fully open ie fold-back and flatten the rotation the screen, even the fact of needing to use 3 fingers to take screen-shots instead of an allocated button, the delete button is actually a back-space not delete button. Notifications keep coming in upper right corner, blocking what I might want to access there. One needs to go through each app to change the setting btw, there's no default to say do not show notifications. It would at least be good to have the option to change the location of where they show up. I much prefer chrome to safari, though found on reading that chrome eats up a lot more power. I downloaded Flotata this morning which is supposed to help though I haven't tried yet. Incredibly frustrating especially when time is very limited, trying to figure things out!! Have spent hours on calls with Apple support which thankfully is very accessible. But my computer seems glitchy, sometimes the screen-sharing doesn't work. I haven't purchased a mouse as yet for it and also finding ""right-clicking"" with 2 finger tapping to be frustrating and not working as I'd expect it to.Overall unfortunately not a happy camper. Maybe for Mac users it may be a good machine for whatever reason.I was also very torn whether to get the 8 or 16gb, I went with the 8. I don't think that would make a difference at this early stage of being new.I also tried to have my teen daughter, who's used to Macs, give me tips though she was't terribly helpful so I watched a couple of YouTube vids which gave some guidance, things are not intuitive.I don't like posting negative reviews, though sharing this in case others in similar situations ie needing to carry on with trying to get things done, while their windows laptop is reaching the end of its life and needing to choose a new machine, may find this helpful.Also as an fyi, I had to pay an additional nearly $300 to have my 2 external hard-drives transferred onto a new Mac compatible one, so I can access all my previous work.Wishing everyone better luck!",2605716033,18536
"Everything about this machine has been fantastic.  I could not afford new, but I have found this only a hairsbreadth less than spanking new.  Best for me, since I was away from the wonderful Apple side for several years, Apple help is as fine as the machine.  Plan to go this route next time.",2605705647,18536
"This laptop is really fast and the battery lasts really long.The battery lasts me about a week with just one charge and I find that crazy.There is not fan noise and this doesn't get hot.The quality is really good.. I mean the way the laptop opens with one hand and the smooth closing of the lid is really smooth.The screen isn't the best but its still really good.This laptop has the M1 chip, fastest chip on the market.This laptop's bench marks are off the roof.It's great for casual use like, watching movies, using word docs and excel sheet, coding and video editing.I wouldn't recommend gaming even though basic games will do just fine.",2605673215,18536
"Nothing wrong with the system, but it took more than 2 weeks to arrive, and in the process, the M2 dropped in price. So I'll return this and get the M2.  A waste of my time when I could have used it most.  The wait was really disappointing.",2605667880,18536
Great product,2605666328,18536
Overpriced and very thin be careful,2605661480,18536
The computer is everything I thought it would be. Gave the camera a 3 star because quality could be better but I don’t use FaceTime as much so it’s not a big deal to me. Overall so worth the money. Great investment for my book writing and finances.Definitely a major upgrade from my HP.Now I wasn’t sure who to contact about delivery or where to write it but I don’t appreciate having told them I want someone to sign for it being it is a high value priced item and it was just thrown on my porch and I wasn’t notified at all then when I go look it says it was directly handed to me. Don’t like liars so Amazon you need to get it together because if this would have gotten stolen I would have raised hell for my money back.-thanks.,2605593001,18536
"I assumed the computer was new, I’m not sure that I did not get a renewed one. The computer seems fine so far, but the charger was defective, and I had to spend 30.00 on a new aftermarket charger. You would think the product would be tested. Not a great experience.",2605566041,18536
Looks and feels fantastic,2605514919,18536
"They sent the wrong color, but it's otherwise great",2605512215,18536
"I hate laptops, until I bought this one anyway. I probably burned through over a dozen  or so over the past decade. One of them was actually another Mac Air. I wasn’t impressed. This 2020 model however provides all the power and versatility that I’ve only previously dreamed about.  The Retina display is gorgeous, clear and easy to read. This PC runs Photoshop faster and cleaner than desktops that cost me $3000 or more. Music played back on this little laptop sounds better than any other I’ve heard.  The new Apple M1 chip really shines, beating the Intel versions of this laptop hands down.",2605407147,18536
"I was hesitant buying a MacBook, I said I'd never do it. But after having my iPhone for so long I and my most recent laptop dying, I figured I could take the chance. I love it, it is basically just an iPhone in laptop form. I will miss Microsoft Office Suite, but I don't really need it for that so it is ok.",2605402808,18536
"I left the Apple product line years ago due to their practice of ""forced obsolesce"" with early iPhone models. Having worked in IT for most of my career I like being able to have full control of my device. Apple mostly locks up their devices.But, I decided to give the MacBook Air 2020 a chance because: 1. my MS Surface didn't last long enough for the money and it, too, is hardware locked and 2. I was impressed with the M1 specification.After playing with this machine I have to say the M1 is AWESOME! The screen response is shockingly quick in comparison to other PCs and Apple devices.I highly recommend ONLY buying an Apple device WITH a M1 processor.",2605402392,18536
Holy cow this is the best product I have ever owned no malicious baloney fast easy to use and very enjoyable recommends product I really do,2605342892,18536
My daughter loves this laptop. She will be taking this same laptop to college. I didn’t like the price but if she’s able to keep this laptop and finish college with it. That will justify the outrageous price.,2605292929,18536
"But, I love this laptop.  After asking multiple people who have purchased the same (or better) models and I couldn't be happier purchasing even the lowest end model of MacBook Air.  Does everything I would expect an Apple Computer to do (for what I need it for, basic photo editing, viewing, and typing). So far it's been an amazing purchase.  Just for the sake of keeping Apple on their toes I rated the Battery Life 4 stars and the camera quality 4 stars, as well as the 4 star overall review.  Keep it up Apple, as long as you continue to make the products user-friendly I'll remain a happy customer for years to come.",2605285296,18536
I ordered gold and received silver. Disappointed and never got contacted by the seller about it but everything else is perfect,2605269376,18536
"I had a 2008 MacBook Pro that I used until 2014. I then switched back to a PC until purchasing this M1 MacBook a month ago. I don’t know why I haven’t been using a Mac sooner. Having messages and FaceTime and synced with my phone, along with MS office functionality makes this computer a dream to use.Only issue I had was using a usb c to display port plug to plug into my monitor. Worked great until the latest update of Big Sur. Have an open case with Apple and they seem perplexed, but a quick review of reddit shows this seems to be an issue with the M1 chip. I ended up purchasing a usb-c to hdmi adapter and have had no further issues, except being out $15 for the first cable.",2605264075,18536
"I switched from a PS to a MacBook Air never dreaming Mac would be sooooooo difficult to operate. Stupid things like images not downloading in some emails, setting up folders, how to download a file to that folder, all are completed, and Apple support is totally for geeks not the average user.If I could afford it, I would burn this computer and buy another PC for all the STRESS the MacBook Air has caused me.",2605252639,18536
"Good for what it's worth.I'm not a fan of the price, but guess it's just another Apple thing.Great laptop for daily use.The key keyboard is great. I'm not a professional on computers so I'll usually have to look at the keyboard while I type, but not on this one the keys are positioned perfectly.Nice and crisp resolution.Pretty fast.All around great daily use laptop.",2605230286,18536
Es más pequeña,2605225421,18536
This is a great laptop that is thin and durable. I would recommend a skin or case due to how lightweight it is!,2605193516,18536
"I love my new MacBook. It convenient, advanced technology, light weight and all of my apple devices are connected!",2605188424,18536
Love this Mac.  Arrived fast and packaged well.  Works great and as a first time Mac user it was very easy to learn.  Great price at Amazon and very happy with the purchase.  The computer is very fast.,2605158065,18536
Si tienes o logras una tarjeta de Amazon puedes pagar mensualmente una  mínima cantidad  y compras una macbook que aunque no es de pantalla táctil es de excelente calidad.,2605127483,18536
The MacBook arrived in new condition. and works wonderfully. I was also able to update to the most recent version of Mac OS. Great value Hundreds off a similar new machine.,2605102139,18536
I’m an APPLE user and not surprised with the functionality and quality,2605058990,18536
"I love this MacBook! The battery life is amazing and I have been able to complete work tasks easily. I love the size because I can carry the MacBook when I travel without having to use a big laptop bag. The screen quality is great, but I had a little difficulty seeing the screen outside in a sunny area. Although, when I found some shade I had no problems at all. I am not outside much in the sun on the MacBook so this isn’t a big deal for me. Overall, great product in my opinion. It is perfect for what I need to do for work.",2604947977,18536
Just about the only thing I have objections to is that I don't really like the touchpad much. It doesn't always behave intuitively and I've had to tweak settings to get it to where I'm fairly comfortable using it.But generally... Solid laptop. Good buy.,2604939685,18536
"This laptop actually lives up to all the hype about the M1 chip and such. It is lightning fast, smooth, clear easy to read screen  and the battery lasts and lasts for all day and then some. Also I have noticed that with any normal use it doesn't even get warm so the lack of a fan is not a detriment but nice as a nonexistent fan can't make any noise. I was slightly skeptical but as a multiple APPLE owner not surprised I was happy. Seriously I just sent a 3 year old iPad that had been used hard daily for a battery replacement and received a brand new iPad 3 days after I sent it in. Thats service as well.",2604935056,18536
"This laptop is perfect for student for collage. It is extremely fast however the restarting of this laptop isn’t that fast which is kind strange. Overall I find no faults with this device, I have the 8gb ram version and it performs like a champ for all my needs as a student. I totally recommend this device.",2604925089,18536
"I'm not really a mac user, but I heard a lot of good stuffs on YouTube about M1 Macbook air and want to give it a try. Guess what. I don't think any Windows laptop around this price range can beat this M1 Macbook air. No fan, so it is quiet yet there is almost no heat. Battery life is insanely good. If you are looking for everyday laptop around 900-1000 bucks, this is it. Highly recommended. However, if you play games alot (especially Windows games), then this is a no go.",2604901508,18536
"Likes:- Great performance despite seemingly underpowered on paper.- Battery life is outstandingDislikes:- There were repeated Safari crashes for first few weeks (since cleared up)- MagSafe plug is gone, though it's nice to have standard USB-C power.- Expensive storage upgrades- A lot of software is still unoptimized for new M1 hardware, but performance is generally acceptable even so- CapsLock delay continues to annoy the hell out of meOther:- Keyboard is fine (upgrading from a 2014 MacBook Pro keyboard, which was solid)- Good for lightweight software development",2604890567,18536
Its a rlly good laptop tbh. The only downfall is that it's not touch screen and isn't rlly good for gaming. Other than that it's amazing!,2604875100,18536
it arrived very well and quickly,2604847192,18536
"I used HP laptops for years, their average screen size is like 17, up to almost 20 inch screen size. For this 13 inch MacBook, at first I was surprised, but the second I set things up I got real excited. Siri is super helpful, Mac is small, very easy to carry, super convenient. One thing I like the most is the Touch ID to open laptop. After using Mac I've decided to purchase the latest iPad, Apple products actually worth the money!",2604815809,18536
Really good,2604805874,18536
"I absolutely love this laptop. I'm a software engineer and as you can imagine I spend a lot of time of the computer. This computer is lightning fast, a dream to type on, and it has a beautiful screen. The only downside is that camera quality, which is absolutely atrocious. I have a desktop PC that I do my web conferencing over anyways, so it's not big deal for me. If you really care about the webcam, I would suggest purchasing a third-party webcam. Other than that, I highly recommend this product and I could not be more pleased with it.",2604764279,18536
"I’ve had my MacBook for about a month now, it’s been amazing. I take it to school everyday and each task I do on my Mac is so seem less. Overall amazing laptop with great battery life and an awesome screen. Definitely recommend for students, keyboard is also nice. Laptop is insanely light weight as well.",2604755798,18536
I got this device to last me another 10 years. Will need to have purchased a connector for separate storage devices for standard USB connectors and camera disks. Like the size and portability. Keyboard and touch pad are fine as this was a concern prior to purchase.,2604749911,18536
"I love this laptop. It's fast, practical, sleek, portable, and very useful for me as a college student who does remote work. I have never had a problem with it and I have been using it for a few months now. 100/10.",2604705829,18536
"So far we have had no problems with it. We bought it for my daughter for college. If there are any hiccups come fall, I can resubmit.",2604693305,18536
It is exactly everything I wanted and I am so happy with my purchase!! I will definitely order again from this company!!,2604685477,18536
"If you need a basic Mac and don't need lots of RAM or processing power, the Mac Air is perfect.  It's fast enough for internet connections, zoom calls, word or spreadsheet, Wordpress, etc.  Get 512GB drive, cuz modern software, photos, etc need more space.",2604543255,18536
Had an intel based MacBook Pro that supported 2 additional displays natively. This one only supports one. Luckily has a display link hub as a workaround fo 2 additional monitors. Had no issues with M1 silicon,2604528218,18536
"Great battery charge length – I haven't tested it such that I could report numbers, but clearly much much better than my previous 2018 Powerbook.Screen very good.The M1 processor is fast, but as expected didn't work on a few peripheral (for me) software types. However, these include iDVD and Microsoft messenger. But then again there may be upgrades available that I feel no compelling reason to pursue.",2604525990,18536
"I absolutely love this laptop. it gets the job done for what I need it for for work. I ran into one issue where I shut it down to charge for some time and then when I tried to restart it it was just a black screen with the arrow on the screen and I had to do a hard restart on it. it has only done that once since I got this but so far I do love it. I have and apple iPhone, iPad, and an Apple Watch and it was very easy to get all systems on the same page.",2604506552,18536
"My son who is studying in Florida called me to tell that his MacBook (7 years old) has some small issues and he is worried it could fail during an important session exam/test which is mostly done online under corona. So we had to buy quickly a new MacBook but where not sure whether the M1 would do it without issues regarding standard programs you use on the daily university live (like Office366, Team viewer, GoodNotes, etc.) Now after 3 week my son tells that there are no issues what’s so ever and he likes the performance and as well as the Batterie runtime. The price and shipping time was good as well!",2604462074,18536
Like any laptop this laptop has its little quirks but overall this is one of the best laptops to purchase. I don't know if this is touchscreen but its not that big of a deal for a person like me . The picture/ video quality is great to look at and is very clear but the Photo Booth camera kinda sucks which is a little disappointing . Other than these little things the laptop is  pretty fast and  has all the essential app to create .,2604411350,18536
"Pros. I Love the new M1 processor, I had an i5 MacBook air before this one that was fast, this one is to me compares to the i9 for speed.Cons, I don't like that you have to buy an adapter to have a USB or to use my camera SD card, plus they took away the magnetic cord you charge with now it is just a plug-in like the Macbook Pro. Being a Computer tech I see problems in the future with it being a plug, they always seem to loosen up as the years go on. Other than that I LOVE IT!",2604400503,18536
"I love this MacBook. It’s the first I’ve ever owned and I don’t  regret it. The only problem with it, like many other Apple products, is compatibility, of course. Other than that, I love it!",2604396647,18536
"I am overall very satisfied with my 2020 Apple MacBook Air purchase. Every works smooth and no problems so far. Powerful laptop. For now, I highly recommend.",2604395808,18536
It’s a good laptop with all around features and heavy build quality. Missing some of the pro features but otherwise it works great,2604393800,18536

Best laptop ever I had,2604285263,18536
As much as I enjoy my new MacBook. It is way too soon to be experiencing loading delays. I barely have anything loaded on the computer and I have experienced several delays.,2604209867,18536
"I just love this Macbook air.  It replaced my 2014 model that was an 11 inch model.  IT is like light years ahead of that computer, although the old one is wonderful too.  The keyboard is smooth as silk and so easy to type on. I could go on and on about the screen.  Crisp, clear, bright, and wonderful.  I really enjoy the backgrounds on Big Sur as well now.  The speed with the M1 chip is phenomenal on all the programs that I use.Youtube is a great place to get more technical reviews than I have left.  But from an ordinary, person this laptop is fabulous.",2604174214,18536
I had a great experience.  I love my new computer!,2604081632,18536
"The MacBook Air is an amazing machine! I absolutely love it!!! I only wish that it had more ports on it. Not a huge deal because I bought a hub for more ports, but would have been nice to see more ports on this thing. Other than that, I love how responsive it is, and I love the picture quality! Also, the battery life on this thing is unreal!!! I have left it off the charger for well over a week and have not needed to charge it. It is amazing!!!",2604063955,18536
"Works as expected. Shipping was quick. The rose-gold color is a very pretty shade. I have had Macs in the past, but not an Air. I love how thin it is. Not many ports and only two USB-C ones, so note that. I mainly needed just my iPhone 12 Pro to be able to plug into it, so it works for me.My last Mac was a 2011 MacBook Pro. It still works great, but I needed some updated stuff. Just the fact that it lasted me 10+ years shows its value. It is worth it. Once you go Mac, you never go back. ;)",2604034038,18536
"Like the updated M1 processor.  Like the extra memory.  Don't like the ""Left outs"".  No lighted apple logo on the cover.  It was replaced by a mirror like decal. (Cheap)  Don't like the lack of ports.  No HCMI, no SDHC memory slot for you camera memory chip, you need to buy adaptor for USBC and there are only 2 on the left none on the right only a 3.5 mm audio jack. In addition when charging the unit there is no indication, no light no sound, nothing that lets you know it is charging.Cheap, cheap cheap....shame on you Apple.",2604001255,18536
"In general I love this MacBook Air. I have had other Apple products but this is my first laptop.  It has a great display, it opens easily with touch (fingerprint) ID, you can move easily from here to there and not lose any information. It is great for most purposes. The things I have had trouble with are the Apple word processing, spreadsheet or presentation programs, so I continue to use Office 365. That is not totally fair in this review as the device is wonderful!",2603980783,18536
Recommended,2603947439,18536
"muy buen producto y calidad. excelente pantalla, funciona perfecto el lector táctil, rápida al abrir pantalla entre muchas otras cualidades. RECOMENDACIONES: comprar un buen protector de la computadora, comprarle un multi conector de 12 en 1 y que trabaje por los 2 puertos USB-C para distribuir la carga y flujo de trabajo. Adicionalmente si su cartera aguanta comprar la version de 16gb de ram, hice pruebas de carga navegación, abrir y cerrar videos de instagram como 6 veces seguidas y me aparecía en pantalla que la carga de la pagina navegada consumía muchos recursos.",2603896891,18536
lo esperado,2603671312,18536
"I have buyers regret now.  I bought this to update from my old Mac Pro and was hoping I could get some streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, etc and none of that is available.  I use my laptop for movies and TV while traveling.  No CD drive and none of the aforementioned items make this laptop basically useless to me",2603649603,18536
Wish build in a word processor.,2603599971,18536
"Overall it works fine except it must be plugged in all the time. battery is garbage, not really refurbished, just resold. I will have to pay $ to put in a new battery at the Apple store. Ugh.",2603592320,18536
"I love my MacBook Air! I chose gold, it’s such a beautiful classy color. It came in original packaging packed very safely. I haven’t tried the camera yet.I switched to iPads since 2010 and haven’t missed crashing windows one bit. I needed to do a few things my iPad wouldn’t do a Mac it was! The battery life is amazing, and the screen brightness is great, I’ve heard it isn’t bright as the MacBook Pro but I can’t believe anything would be brighter! I can’t put the brightness but half way up.",2603579772,18536
"There’s nothing I don’t like and I’m sure I have not explored everything in my new Air. pro, the screen quality is great, I do not have touch screen and I do not play games on the Computer only on my IPhone.To make along story short, it’s great.",2603579005,18536
"Excellent battery, speedy, lightweight. You do not often come across these three benefits together. This is still a great purchase if you (like me) do the regular zoom meetings, graphic design, edit 4k video, some spreadsheet work and occasionally edit batches of 100 photos in raw format in Lightroom. Go spend some more in a M1 Pro or Max if you really need that much computational power for 3d or heavy 8k video editing.",2603573996,18536
I needed a new computer and this one is just right for me. Very easy to set up and user friendly. I don't know a lot about computers but my sons said I made a good choice with this one. The rose gold is a fun color and a change from drab gray or silver.,2603566391,18536
"This is my first Apple computer and I love it.  Just be aware that this MacBook Air doesn't natively support two external monitors.  All you need to do however, is buy theHyperDrive Dual 4K HDMI 10-in-1 USB-C Hub directly from Hyperdrive to resolve this issue.",2603518004,18536
"No option to buy a macbook air at a bigger size, this screen feels a bit small, no 120hz and, no touchscreen really makes it feel dated. Great battery life, the metal finish is really slippery, I bought a d-brand skin to fix that. Good little laptop for general use, web browsing, lite gaming.The screen, even for a 60hz panel has some ghosting that may bother some.",2603434683,18536
My feet.,2603355408,18536
"This is my 4th Mac laptop, the earlier ones were all MacBook Pros.  I was reticent about getting an Air, but with the M1 chip, this thing is a superb replacement.  So small & light, yet speedy.  Only drawback is the fixed 8GB RAM complement.  I take care not to send the thing into swap- suspending old browser tabs is essential.",2603285356,18536
"This is a M1 Macbook Air what more can we say?  We went with Used - Good Condition Space Gray in order to save money and so far everything looks and works well.  There were 2 battery cycles, minor signs of use on the bottom, and the charger was obviously used but otherwise its in good shape.  There were about 8 months of factory warranty left and I couldn't add applecare+ since it was bought used so I went with a 3rd party warranbty service instead.",2603266523,18536
"Best laptop you can buy but mine came scratched idk why Apple is trying to punish me for but it's fine. Also be really careful because the screen is special, it has a coating for retina display and even touching it or gently cleaning it can remove some of the coating and leave subtle blue marks. Sound is boxy I'd recommend SpeakerAmp and choose flat sound to get a clearer sound. But nothing is perfect of course and for that price this is a great investment",2603217793,18536
I got this for school after my hp computer's battery stopped working. It's really great for the price! the screen resolution is really nice and the touch id is a good add on. I really wish apple would make touch screen macbooks but they probably never will. it also doesn't have a usb port which is kind of weird. learning the controls takes some time but overall a great computer!,2603174343,18536
"Smaller form than the Macbook Air it replaced but screen size was the same. Lighter, too! The rose gold is beautiful and the computer works incredibly well and is lightning fast. Migration assistant made data transfer from old to new a piece of cake. Absolutely love it!",2603148902,18536
I love my new Apple MacBook Air. It’s has a new operating system that I am getting used to. The machine itself is wonderful it reminds me of my G4 and PRO Power Tower the great grandfather and parent of my new MacBook Air. As soon as I get PS I will be dancing with my new toy and being creative again. My MacBook Air arrived in great condition and ready to go. I have been an Apple girl for many years and love their products. Thank you so much.,2603146621,18536
Nothing comes close. Best value for top class product. its an APPLE. closest to this is a Surface but the OS in this thing is much safer and built with more security in mind.,2603140909,18536
"Can't add much that hasn't already been said. I upgraded from a 2017 MacBook Air and find this to be superior in just about every way. The battery life is at least twice what the 2017 was, the screen is much better, the keyboard is better, the overall size of the computer is smaller and I love the larger haptic feedback touchpad. I don't use the camera but it isn't the greatest from what I understand and I do kind of miss the magsafe connector.",2603138140,18536
"I gave this purchase a run around and delayed purchasing it for a good while, but I cant stress enough how amazing this computer has been. I take it around with me for studying and playing music and just basic stuff but is amazing, the m1 chip is quite a game changer.",2603135146,18536
I had a MacBook Pro 13 2015...that machine lasted a long time and I love it. It dropped and I needed a replacement fast. MacBook Air 2020 is not a disappointment. The battery life even if downloading is incredible. I had it downloading all night and I still have a charge. It was only a slow download because the internet speed sucks. The touch ID is a delight. I love the picture quality. So far I am so impressed. Hopefully it will last as much as the other lasted.,2603128530,18536
"Recibi el articulo con la misma calidad que el de una tienda. Sin problemas hasta el momento. Inicialmente pensé que el equipo tendría 8 GPU sin embargo he recibido la versión de 7 GPU aunque para mí esta bien hubiese querido 8, creo que parte de la descripción del producto eran 8 GPU.En cuanto a la temperatura un poco preocupado porque en ciertos momentos del día presenta un indice alto para mi, sin embargo consultando con Apple vía soporte me han comentado que se encuentra dentro de los rangos.",2603060887,18536
"Such a nice laptop. I am upgrading from a 2012 MacBook and this one is light years ahead of the game compared to that one. It’s slim, fast, user friendly, and the iconic apple products that I’ve grown to love.",2603057228,18536
The only issue I have is when watching Apple TV. The sound quality Isaac under heavy bass,2603050402,18536
"I'm giving this a 5 star because the laptop is perfect for what it is and the seller was great, however I watched multiple YouTube videos glorifying the M1 chip as being fast enough that 8GB could handle a ton of open applications. I need a bunch of tabs open for my work, use Canva constantly, and occasionally need to open Photoshop too so I needed to return this and buy 16GB. But that's my fault and the YouTube reviews faults, not the laptop. Battery life is amaaaazing though!",2602963131,18536
"No dislikes with this product.  Likes, it is easy to use and navigate which i loved from the start.",2602952317,18536
It's a good laptop. It's an Apple so it is overpriced but you have to expect that buying any Apple product,2602931252,18536
"I've always been a windows PC user. The brand I normally get doesn't sell anymore. I decided to switch to Mac. Oh my...I wish I'd done it sooner. I love this computer so much. It's fast. The screen quality is amazing. I had to get used to it not being a touch screen but it's worth losing that feature. I don't miss windows at all. Everything is so much easier to use. If you're hesitating, don't. You won't regret it.",2602905664,18536
"Yo compré esta computadora porque mi antigua laptop tenía seis años y me estaba causando muchas dificultades en mi trabajo y con mis clases. Entran en zoom era un problema y con está computadora no me ha pasado. Es la primera vez que tengo una Mac y aunque al principio me costó un poco acostumbrarme al sistema de apple, pero la rapidez y duración de la bateria valen la pena. Es muy fácil trabajar con esta computadora, mientras que con la otra podía esperar hasta una hora para que terminara de cargar un programa. La recomiendo.",2602895876,18536
"The outward look of this Mac Air is not that different from my MacBook Pro that I bought in 2015 - with one exception: the new model has the M1 Chip and it never seams to heat up. The old model sizzled enough to brand your legs if you use it in laptop position.No complaints on Apple products, though. I can only hope this M1 model lasts as long. It’s a good bet because heat is one of the chief reasons for internal parts going bad. This is one cool computer!",2602889534,18536
This is my second time purchasing an Apple Computer. They last a really long time. I got this one for my business.,2602880938,18536
"No issues with this MacBook, came in perfect condition, very easy to navigate, LOVE the Touch ID, and the camera quality is okay, not as good as a phone. The battery lasts about an entire day, and the charger that comes with it is super high quality. Buttons are very big and easy to see and push, the lighting on them is perfect. The touch pad being bigger is wonderful! Very light and easy to handle, get as much storage as you can afford. Able to do everything I need & more, 100% recommend.",2602867308,18536
so nice,2608508496,18536
"First time with a MacBook and it feels awesome. Nice OS, overall good look, sound and display have very good quality, battery life outstanding. The camera is mediocre though. I have always worked with windows and Linux and I’m getting used to this OS and I’m starting to love it. Similar feel when I was changing from Android to iPhone. I downloaded and installed Office 365 in a few minutes, for programming Python and Sublime Text work just fine. Safari works so fast! No complain after a week with this laptop",2608443700,18536
Decided to switch from Windows and PC laptops to Apple MacBook and never turning back. Quality hardware and software and looking forward to many years of happy use. I can recommend this product.,2608413570,18536
"Just have to say I'm really thrilled with the new M1 MacBook Air - worked all day (8+ hours) on a rather complex Excel workbook and the laptop never got warm and the battery is still at 43%! Can't say enough good things about this computer. The cost was within budget and the performance, well it's better than my iMac in many ways! Really glad I didn't wait for the next model to start enjoying Apple's new computer on a chip design. Thanks Apple!",2608388608,18536
"This was everything I expected it to be. The screen is small but bright. I use it for virtual teaching, it handles zoom, google meets and all my other needs. I can use my iPad as a second screen when needed. I like how my Apple ID paired this with all my devices. I charge it daily and it gets me though my daily needs. The only thing I didn’t get was a notification to purchase AppleCare. It’s easy enough to do online.",2608351627,18536
This computer is awesome and full of plenty of power to do the most complex computing.It does not have a touch screen. I love mine!,2608343958,18536
"This is my very first MacBook! I’ve been wanting to have one but couldn’t afford it. I was using my Sony laptop since 2004 and it finally broke. I thought, if I was gonna buy a new laptop it should be MacBook so I did save some money for it, but my savings could only afford MacBook Air 2020. I love it! It’s looks cool and I enjoy using it and will probably use until it lasts lol.",2608333054,18536
I like the addition of the biometric authentication.  The set up was easy.  The transfer from old Mac to new Mac was a few hours but we are talking about a huge amount of data.  Everything transferred with no problems.,2608297296,18536
"I’ve owned Mac’s for over 25 years and this is the worst I’ve ever owned. First off, the mouse buttons are a new horrible design that often do not recognize mouse clicks. Clicking this mouse is the worst experience I’ve ever had on any computer before. My previous 2018 Mac was much better in so many ways.Also i hate that this new Mac only has 2 ports both being USB-c. One is used to charge which means you only have a single USB-c port for use. Another huge downgrade.Also this Mac has the fancy new fingerprint scanner unlock and yet it forces me to re-enter my password constantly. So what is the point of a fingerprint scanner if i still need to re-enter my password 80% of the time?The keyboard also feels cheap and is very uncomfortable to use, another downgrade from my 2018 Mac. Literally this thing feels like a massive downgrade in nearly every way.",2608281519,18536
"The MacBook Air is as advertised. Fast and easy to use with a long battery life. Too few ports for my taste, and the keyboard is only OK. I use a Logitech mouse via Bluetooth, and it is responsive. One positive surprise is that the speakers in the laptop are better than those I've used in bigger machines.",2608263734,18536
"I am really pleased with this upgrade. My last one is a 2015 MacBook Air. It still works, but I wanted a more up to date one. The price was good and I love it.",2608247828,18536
So far I’m super happy. I’ve always bought cheap laptops but felt it was time to invest in something better. I’ve never owned a Mac and fell in love immediately. It’s so nice to have my phone and watch work in sync with my computer. I didn’t realize what I was missing. It’s fancy and pretty and while I worry I might break it because it’s so thin and was pretty pricey I just can’t regret the purchase. I love it.,2608233130,18536
"We own a MacBook Pro but needed a second laptop to keep the marriage from going off the tracks.  Bought the MacBook Air and are very pleased.  It's lighter than our pro, has similar performance, is a bit lighter and cheaper.  The only negative is that its two USBC ports are on one side, makes it trickier to keep it plugged in our seating situation.  Probably not an issue for most.  Oh, the battery life seems better than the Pro.  Definitely recommend it.",2608221876,18536
so my thoughts are on the M1 air version and I must say its a great machine for the price it's my first apple device as I'm a pc gamer but I had to have this because of the ARM chipset being that it surpasses a lot of x86 chipsets it's very impressive the battery life is by far the most impressive thing about it...nothing at the moment beats the battery life it's great it has a great IPS display as well looks very vivid and sharp,2608190257,18536
The product is a 5/5 but Amazon and Chase get 0/5. I purchased this item over the holidays and got a great deal by selecting the 18 month interest-free payment plan. However there was NOTHING indicating that I needed to change my automatic payment settings in order for this plan to actually work (except for an email I received the day AFTER the full amount was charged). I first called Chase who told me they could refund the amount - but that they could not reinstate the payment plan promo that Amazon offered and I would be charged interest until the balance was paid off. Then I called Amazon who said there was nothing they could do and I needed to call Chase. I am beyond furious and severely disappointed with Amazon for not making this apparently necessary step more clear from the very beginning. I purchased this laptop to start my own business and now I am going into it with an overdrawn account. I hope my review  helps someone else avoid this mess.,2608161627,18536
"This was my first MAC purchase! the QUALITY, ENGINEERING, CRAFTMANSHIP is TOP notch! Surprisingly NOT HARD to adapt to using coming from a PC! VERY happy.. absolutely LOVE all the VERY helpful features, still discovering NEW ones & FASTER ways to do things on it EVERYDAY. Plus it LOOKS like a million bucks & very nice/addictive feel to the the touch.. can't say ENOUGH GOOD things about MacBook Air.. APPLE - - you've hit a GRAND SLAM with this one & the M1 chip!! thanks.",2608032103,18536
"I was looking for a laptop that was easy to use, light and portable since I live in a apartment with wife and 2 kids there is no space to have a full blown desk so I needed something small and fast and this new MacBook Air is perfect, I love everything about it,  battery life is great but then again I mostly use it for light web browsing and email checking nothing heavy",2608025421,18536
"Love apple, but wish it was easier to adapt and find thing after using windows for so long. I have to search in safari for answers. Once, I figure out everything I will be much happier because it is so much faster.",2608015137,18536
Great price and great computer!!,2607995792,18536
"Ive had this computer for 2 months now, and I still can’t find a single thing to complain about. The battery will last me 12 hours of gaming, something I didn’t think was even possible out of a high-performance laptop. When I say high performance, I mean it. This thing runs Minecraft on 60 fps with fancy graphics and 24 chunks of render distance; and it doesn’t even get hot! This is probably one of the best tech purchases I’ve ever made.",2607993042,18536
"What a great improvement over my old MacBook Pro. This is my third such computer. It keeps me in touch with the world and Amazon. What bugs me is the razzle dazzle passwords I must come up with to access other sites which is why I use Amazon almost exclusively There are so many goodies on this one that I will probably use only a few, though it is made for the new generation of users. Great product. Thanks Applel",2607949935,18536
"This Macbook was good until the screen started to glitch on the bottom and left side of the display. Apple said the screen didn't have damage, but needs to be replaced. It's 14 months old, outside of the one year warranty, and a new display costs $428. I will not be buying another Macbook in the future.",2607943616,18536
"Battery life is great, once you are not doing to much things. I had a glitch with the mouse the first day I bought it. But I have not seen it again from that day. It is portable, nice slim laptop, not heavy, work well so far. Camera quality is not so good, I think apple could have updated their camera quality, but it is fine anyways, usable. The speakers are loud and nice. Nice sound quality.",2607936441,18536
"I'm a mac guy and have been purchasing mac products for years.  I was taken back by the camera quality on this product.  It was strange that the 2015 macbook air that I sold before getting this 2020 version had a much better camera.  The camera quality is horrible.  It almost looks like a camera from 2001.  Other than that the product is great, and does what it needs to do.",2607936362,18536
"Work perfectly, worth money no cracks or anything wrong came perfect packaged",2607912874,18536
"I had tremendously high hopes for this CPU especially after reading the reviews of its 'speed', factually this is the slowest CPU I have ever used. The loading of web pages is truly pathetic, especially for 2021 and especially for the processor. The usual crap about speeding up the loading time is the usual garbage, 'clear the cache, is there enough room on the HD...' bla bla bla...' The damn thing is absurdly slow. The build quality is exceptional, the case is +, etc., and using the box offline is fine in terms of speed, but loading web pages, getting hung up on web pages, etc. is just plain BS. If anyone has any real advise on how to speed this thing up I would appreciate it but I am seriously thinking about returning it... My 2012 Lenova is actually faster. My INT is a fiber optics with plenty of juice...",2607799225,18536
Totalmente nuevo.,2607794795,18536
I ordered a mouse with the laptop but haven't even taken it out of the box because the trackpad is so good. The keyboard is sweet and I love the TouchId feature. I'm coming from a Windows background and this was so easy to set up. I'm so happy with it. The battery lasts a long time. Everything about this laptop is a breeze. Glad I took the plunge.,2607769408,18536
"Beautiful computer, light weight,  sophisticated, very smart, great for school!!!!",2607755546,18536
"Este Portatil tiene muchas cosas buenas, entre ellas destaco la camara es mejor q la de mi anterior Asus y la rapidez que tiene para ejecutar las aplicaciones, apesar de solo tener 8GB es suficiente y la nitidez de las pantallas de Mac siempre son superiores- Dura bastante la bateria, (tampoco las 18 horas que dicen ellos, pero si mas de 8 horas)Desventajas: que solo tiene dos puertos ThunderboltLlego muy bien empacado hasta Colombia",2607732560,18536
"The M1 MacBook Air is my favorite portable Mac I’ve ever owned. It runs really great with the M1 chip. Battery Life is seriously all day. I normally go for the most RAM I can get, but went with the 8GB as Amazon had a sale and I don’t regret it. Can simultaneously run lots of Browser tabs, Slack, and all my other work apps with no sluggishness.",2607706434,18536
"This MBA is fan-TAS-tic to use. It can run unplugged all day. The speaker is sufficiently loud, and the hi-rez screen is eye-popping.But using a Mac laptop's USB-C port for power, after more than a decade of Mag-Safe bliss, is darn-near CRIMINAL. Thankfully, we still have capitalism, and there are a number of 3rd-party workaround devices that mimic Mag-Safe to a greater-or-lesser degree. Sigh.",2607705074,18536
"Wow!  came fast and brand new, thank you",2607700366,18536
"This is my first laptop my other Mac was a 21.5 desktop, so it has taken me a while to get used to it but I love it. It is light where I can take it from room to room. I do puzzles online and it took some time to figure how to make the screen just a little bigger but I am pleased with it. It is very fast andThe battery lasts quite a while I haven’t had an issue with it. Overall am very pleased with it.",2607674373,18536
"I am not computer savvy, but find this Mac to be easy to use.  I was limping along on a 12 year old MacBook Pro and could not even update to the new OS (Big Sur), so it was time.  I didn't need the big footprint of a MacBook Pro so this is a good fit.  I'm still finding my way around but so far, so good.",2607657849,18536
Bought this for use while traveling. Does everything I need tho I am on a learning curve going from my windows machine at home.,2607648565,18536
I love this laptop it’s very light it’s very thin the screen is a great size not too big not too small the battery life is great Mine did not come with the touchscreen but I really don’t have a need for it the keyboard is perfectly fine I highly recommend this laptop I can’t say anything bad about it would buy it again,2607591836,18536
"APPLE makes the best computers!  Reliable, there are no viruses, and they have the amazing APPLE CARE support for all their computers.  I also learned tat the only reason to purchase their separate Apple Care insurance is if you are concerned about the computer hardware, such as a broken screen.  APPLE makes all your tech needs easier and is my first and only choice.",2607581140,18536
"The touchpad is silky smooth, no need to buy another mouse at all, the sound quality is very nice, and the battery life is also very strong",2607473910,18536
I bought what I considered to be a “Rose Gold” MacBook and it’s absolutely beautiful. It works just as well. I’m just Mac’ing away with course studies as well as my business. Now I can work at home or take it with me wherever I go. It’s light weight and the resolution is amazing. So much better than the laptop I was using.,2607442739,18536
"No complaints so far - in fact, I am actually very impressed! The battery life is incredible (although I have only had it for two days!) and the screen, keyboard, and body are great. I had a Macbook Pro (2012) eons ago and this is obviously far and above that.I was a bit nervous buying from Amazon but I was impatient and couldn't wait the 2+ weeks it was going to take from Apple or Best Buy. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.",2607429571,18536
"I'm an Apple girl, using apple products most of my adult life.  This is the best computer that I have purchased.  The updates that they have made have made these computers even faster, quieter, and more.  Due to the updates on the MacBook Air, you can do as much with Photoshop, InDesign, iMovie, PremierPro, and music programs that you can with the MacBook Pros, only more compact.  I would definitely encourage you to grab this one if you have the opportunity to.",2607414409,18536

"The only thing I can’t figure out , and I haven’t put much effort into it since I’m in the hospital is how to turn on the touch screen option. I thought it would be automatically on . Other than that I love my new MacBook Air Laptop and would recommend it to anyone looking for a laptop computer",2607354574,18536
"I’ve owned three MacBook Airs over the years and this is the most capable to date. Processing speed and battery life are excellent, and the screen is outstanding. I’m still getting used to having just two USB-C ports. I had to purchase an external hub to connect to an external monitor and an external hard drive and I especially miss not having a built in SDHC card reader.",2607306020,18536
"My first time MacBook experience, there are many things to learn, my iPhone and iPad  experiences helps, that is the Apple system, its shares so many apps, functionalities, the  M1 chip is amazing, laptop never got warm and I use it for three or four days without charging.I have migrated many window office documents to Mac, am still learning so far I'm impressed with the new Mac air. quality is top notch",2607250747,18536
A plus quality as expected however no port outlets for other services,2607199582,18536
I love this computer. It is very light and easy to travel with. It is not air cooled so not hot bottom or the noise of a fan cooling system. Was super easy to set up.,2607103274,18536
Muy buen equipo,2607094534,18536
Very nice product. Brand new right out of the box,2607093756,18536
I never owned a Mac before and I am very pleased with this purchase. I was nervous about ordering it off Amazon at first but it was slightly cheaper and came in exactly two days. No issues with damages or overall quality. Screen quality/graphics are great. I am able to play most of the computer games I wanted to on here with no overheating issues. Battery lasts a while depending on what I am doing and charges very quickly.,2607069226,18536
Great product from Apple as usual,2607041610,18536
"Had mine since April and I gotta tell you, I’m literally lost for words. I won’t make this length cause I don’t have to, all you need to know is that this is a must have for anyone wanting to get productivity and entertainment out of a laptop.",2607036411,18536
"Also I have been a Microsoft user for many many years, I decided to take the leap for a new OS and computer to expand my technology IQ and support for a new OS.I am impress by the small footprint-weight and especially the speed, resolution and ease of use with Mac OS Big Surf functionally. I would encourage anyone wanting to take the same leap- this the computer to start. I have evening carried over some my Windows OS applications- i.e. Office 0365- it works",2607013520,18536
"I'm a Windows guy.  I bought this because I am creating a few apps.  The apps aren't ready; so I really haven't used it yet, beyond exploring for a few hours.  It's neither fast, nor large, by today's standards, but it is solid, light, and robust with Apple's latest release.  It'll last for years.No way to connect Apple's top products:  Mac Air and iPhone.  I guess I need more cables.  Please, sir, take more of my money.",2607007867,18536
The display is wonderful. Touchpad is very responsive. I love the size and weight. Very easy to use anywhere,2606996900,18536
"I absolutely love love my new lap top! I had a Macbook Air in college and now I have one for working at home and for traveling if the desire arises! The price is great and the quality is excellent, I noticed other reviews commenting on the quality of the video, however I do not see it being grainy at all!",2606959194,18536
It was a very nice laptop! Loved the color. The specs was great. I am not very comfortable or familiar with Apple products. Returned for a refund and bought a Windows laptop. Really wanted to keep it but had a hard time figuring out how to use it.,2606922665,18536
"What’s not to like? It’s a great Apple product! Bought to replace a 2013 MacBook Pro that worked flawlessly right up until it was destroyed in an accident. Setting it up and getting on with my life was pretty seamless, as it has been on every Apple product I’ve ever upgraded. I’m enjoying the increased speed and more up to date features as a bonus — especially longer battery life!",2606874181,18536
"This new Mac is more powerful than all previous versions, runs silent (no fans), dissipates heat under the heaviest of loads with no throttling, and does so while lasting 48 hours on a chafe and being almost as light as your phone.People taking about M1 being an issue either don’t know enough to figure it out or are straight lying. Everything works fine.If you’re looking to upgrade, you can’t go wrong with this.",2606836523,18536
"I tried to edit a 17 minute 4K60FPS video in Final Cut Pro. Yeah, that didn't happen. Somehow afterward my hard drive was basically full, and no matter how many files I deleted I could only get to 30 gig free max.Returning this and buying a M1 MacBook Pro with 32 gig of ram, which Amazon does not sell.If you just want to watch YouTube and browse the internet this is a fine computer. However, anything beyond that and you will be disappointed.",2606801004,18536
Very good computer,2606798944,18536
"found it complicated and deprecated quickly.  The purchase price for me was 1000 saw it at 90 less 2 months later now it's almost $200 less.  Don't feel too good about this,",2606752356,18536
"I put this along side my £3,500 13” MacBook Pro (2019), which was spec’d up to the max, and the M1 Air wiped the floor with it. Twice as fast encoding the same video, making my top of the line Intel MacBook Pro instantly obsolete. You can not go wrong with this purchase. This is the biggest evolutionary leap in desktop computing since the early 00’s. I’m just upset I bought this as a gift for someone else.",2606735245,18536
I was a bit concerned when I saw the reviews saying that its camera was really bad because I teach online and do a lot of Zoom video calls. But it's so much better than my old PC laptop and might be as good as my iPhone 8 Plus camera. I am shook!,2606715912,18536
"This computer was described as used but like new, I would have guessed it was new because it looks brand new. It's the latest MacBook Air and I got it cheaper than through the Apple store. I was anxious to get it but shipping said it could take 3-7 days from when I ordered it. I was pleasantly surprised to get it on the third day. This is replacing my 2013 MacBook Pro Retina. I love it.",2606689135,18536
"My husband bought me one for Christmas 2020 and my son loved it so we bought him one for Christmas 2021. Great laptop, great price for MacBook. Only thing is I wish it was a touch screen. Love it!!!",2606614428,18536
"Unexpectedly this turned out to be a espectacular laptop. Yes, some applications are still not available natively for the M1 chip but even through emulation they are very fast to use. Camera despite having the same.720p res it has a better image quality and I assume this is due to the chip processing image better than intel. For everyday use this is perfect for other tasks such as programming not yet.",2606603661,18536
"This is my first laptop and I’m real happy with the purchase. The speakers on this are nice and loud I love it. The size is a great size, not too big and definitely not too small, it’s just right. The screen is great too love the picture quality and it gets brights. I’m not super in tune with all the laptop lingo and things that matter but as a person who just bought their first laptop, definitely worth it.",2606601150,18536
"My wife likes it. Extremely overpriced for today's specs and she couldn't even play a Sims game from 2011 on it. . . But hey, she can edit pics. . . . For $1200. Paid for love, crapple product.",2606597634,18536
"I love its bootup sound and appearance BUT, it wont run any of my old software.  So what good is that?  Just because it purrs like a kitten it ain't worth a thing to me.  So that is why I am returning mine.  Unless you never owned a computer buy it.  Too reinvest in all the needed software whould be out of my price range.",2606554764,18536
"I'm absolutely stunned by this laptop, it's pefect in every way. Super fast with incredible screen quality and the outside color (rose gold) is beautiful!! It's extremely light and can be carried anywhere. I did get a protector because I was afraid to damage it since it's so light I felt like I could add a bit of protection so I put a clear plastic case and it still feels very thin and light.",2606531664,18536
it works really well! the screen quality is very good and clear. I’ve been doing schoolwork on mine and it allows me to do things my other computer will not. overall a very beautiful laptop and great purchase! would recommend!!,2606490648,18536
"First time owning a MacBook, I didn't want to cheap out on a good computer for school so I chose this and it does not fail to deliver. Very responsive and runs smooth when operating, I even don't mind using it without a mouse as it's trackpad is excellent. Crazy how this thing is so quiet. Very happy with the purchase!",2606477321,18536
I’m a college student and bought this right before my semester started and it is my most favorite thing!! I was kind of hesitant it would be fake but it really is the real deal and I love my MacBook Air!,2606472979,18536
WINNER WINNER APPLE DINNER...it is a gem...software setup cumbersome but once done...it kicks assTHe trackpad lil stiff on clicking to select...guess breaking in will solve it...Rosetta 2 had to be installed..so it can run intel based apps..if you get pop up ...install it...had me goingBut for the money..it is fast..and installed new update...loads of preinstalled goodies...APPLE got this one right...the webcam they should have splurged on...they couponed out ..but good enough...3rd party apps will fix,2606456587,18536
"Great lightweight laptop. Hard to get used to the new command keys if you are not an apple user already. Great migration operation from other laptops even windows applications.  Not easy to fix or troubleshoot when necessary. Had to get tech support to correct a bug with the M1 chip(hard drive), it was fixed but took an hour on the phone",2606409504,18536
"This is the first Apple computer I've ever had and I adore my Mac. I originally bought it for editing my videos for my YouTube channel (Rae of Sun Asmr) which is still its main function. Now however, I almost prefer watching things like Netflix, etc. on here vs on my actual television. Picture quality on this thing is superior. Highly recommend.",2606346863,18536
The battery life in this laptop exceeds everything I've ever seen before. On a full charge after being on standby for a week I still have 90% battery left. In the past I've always been afraid to leave my laptop for any period of time without shutting it down. Now I never shut it down. an occupational reboot after an update or something is all it needs.,2606340672,18536
Have just opened and planning on taking to Apple store and have data transferred from old Mac Pro Book to the MacBoook Air.  It is much more sleek and lighter than the older Book Pro.  So far so good.,2606336623,18536
"Other then battery life this thing is awesome. No complaints, lightning fast, never had a single problem with anything as of yet. Would like the battery to last more then a few hours but it could also be everything I have running on the computer. Overall I would recommend this to my friends and family",2606323107,18536
"Best computer i have ever had, very good job Apple. Comparing to many brands HP, Acer, Dell, etc this is a rocket based on price, speed, image, performance, everything. just the best buy you can ever have, dont doubt it for a second.Btw i rarely do reviews for stuff i buy but it deserves it, could not be happier!",2606314773,18536
"I have own a apple iPad and now this ,it is everything I could ask for in a laptop.I have own several other laptops made by different manufacturers and everyone failed me! this is far better and very easy to setup I had no problems setting it up at all! very pleased and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fast and powerful laptop!",2606301679,18536
"I just got my new macbook air and was super excited as it is my first ever mac computer, but it will not turn on! Hopefully I will be able to return it, but either way it is going to be a hassle. A big reason I bought this was that I was tired of my windows laptop taking forever on windows updates and often being slow, but at least that thing can turn on.Very disappointed with this I thought one of the big selling points with mac products was that they ""just work"". When I first opened it after it arrived, it would not turn on. I figured ok, I thought they come with some battery life but I guess I have to charge it. It turned on ONCE after charging it for a bit and then never again. After I went through the initial setup config I closed the laptop to let it finish charging. I came back an hour later and it would not turn on! I have tried charging it. I have tried plugging the charger into a different outlet. I have reseated the usb-c cable and tried both ports. I have held down the power button for 10+ seconds. I have tried hitting control + command + power. It doesn't do anything doesn't even make a boot up sound it just won't turn on. Looks like I am going back to a windows laptop I have never had one that completely doesn't work at least.",2606299374,18536
"I've only had it a few weeks, but I love it. I had an old one that couldn't be updated, so this is a great replacement. The sound quality is excellent.",2606291193,18536
"I am glad it finally came, took longer then advertised for shipping. Came with everything as advertised. No broken seals.",2606244585,18536
"My whole experience with ordering a MacBook off of amazon was amazing. It was smooth and easy, and showed up to my front door extremely early. I would venture to say that it was one of my favorite purchases and amazon made it that much easier. I would recommend for anybody to do this same thing.",2606210494,18536
Amazon had the best price at the time. Great machine. The keyboard is sublime. There are plenty of online reviews on websites and YouTube. This machine truly hits the sweet spot.,2606155946,18536
"This is replacing a 11 inch air that I spilled a beer on.  I pretty much love everything about it except the bigger size and heavier weight.  Battery life is amazing.  Speed, still hard to get used to.I loved the smaller size though.",2606144182,18536
Great purchase,2606138022,18536
This MacBook is super fast and convenient to use. Typical Apple quality but yes you will have to pay a price for it.  The M1 chip is amazing and worth it.  Wish the bezels weren't as big but you can't get everything right?  Highly recommend if you are a fan of Apple. Very lightweight and portable.,2606094170,18536
"I love my MacBook, battery is so good. Camera isn’t amazing but it’s pretty good, but you have to remember…. This is a laptop. Prefect for zoom!  So as long as your not taking your MacBook on a photo shoot, camera quality is great! Screen is small. But it’s fine! Lighter than a feather!",2606039228,18536
"FASTEST PERFORMANCE , LONG BATTERY LIFE, LIGHTWEIGHT,COMPACT, GREAT SECURITY FEATURES, TOO MANY THINGS TO LIST BUT THEN IT IS AN APPLE!",2606034857,18536
First Mac laptop I’ve owned and I’m very impressed! Display colors are incredible. Processing speed with the M1 chip is amazing. Super long battery life and light weight. So much packed in a thin design!,2606032622,18536
"Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well.",2606031432,18536
"Bought this for my mom, she wanted to use a mouse. I gave her one of my old mouse. Where is the usb port? 20 more dollars for an addon for usb ports!, 720 camera still on a 2020 product come one!Everything else is great. wow, woah",2606020377,18536
Love this computer! I am a PC user switching to Mac for the first time! The computer comes in perfect condition and extra boxes for additional protection.It also arrived so quickly even when it was Black Friday. Thanks Amazon!,2605931579,18536
"The m1 MacBook Air is the perfect machine blending the best aspects of cell phone computing with the functionality of a laptop. This means unparalleled performance, amazing battery life, and beautiful screen quality. Along with these improvements the keyboard is also refined and no longer used the dreaded scissor mechanism. The only improvement I could ask for is the webcam.",2605876066,18536
Such a high quality and well-built piece of computing equipment. The M1 processor is a huge leap forward.,2605869934,18536
"Unbelievable difference from my prior Air. So much faster. I have run into a couple of small issues with software due to the new chip, but I'm sure they'll release new versions soon. The main one for me right now is that Google FIle Stream doesn't work. I found a substitute called odrive which works to sync w/ Google, but it is a paid product. Hope that's fixed by Google soon.",2605828390,18536
"I returned this MacBook Air very quickly. The default  font on most everything was too small, and there was limited/or no capacity to use zoom in effectively.",2611150457,18536

"So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and there’s a glitch in the front camera’s portrait mode. That’s fine, it may happen. But what’s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!",2610987373,18536

Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and I’m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife.

"Don't buy Apple products from Amazon. I got a defective product which is not activating. During first charging the iPhone started heating like anything. Since there was a 10 days replacement policy, so I asked Amazon to replace it as the product is defective. But very poor customer service from Amazon. They didn't change the iPhone rather told me to visit service centre. Now I am with a defective product which is not operating.",2610491799,18536
Face recognition is slower some times. I have no complaints about it. I am die hard fan of XR. I was eagerly waiting for dual sim iPhone. It’s heavy but looks are so attractive that you will be ready to carry that little extra weight. I am using it since two months. Don’t watch any reviews. Just buy it and enjoy. Yes it’s expensive. Sometimes rather many times money is not worth than happiness.,2610481929,18536

It is not supporting any type of sim.. the network gets disconnected after sometime only,2610334117,18536
"i always was unhappy with the size of my previous iPhones (iPhone 7 and 5s), I badly needed an upgrade and but don’t have the budget of 1lakh so I took my chances with XR and I am very happy with my purchase.",2610326765,18536
This is a product which lets down the whole high end feel of an iPhone. Apple has packed in a very sophisticated software hardware system in a rather disappointing design and the phone is bulkier and heavier than any of its competition in the market. The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera. Overall a cheap buy for an apple lover but for a first time user the phone is totally let down.,2610316332,18536
Im facing some speaker related issues and had given my handset XR 64 Gb in service center they denied to repair the same stating that the handset is fake and not valid for any warrenty,2610302927,18536
All in all an amazing product yet again from Apple. I know many people are confused wheather to go for an apple X or Xr. Well to be frank i suggest XR purely because of the fact that XR will have 1yr more support from Apple in respect to X.  Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you gotta understand you can insert just 1 sim. The 2nd sim is an eSim which needs to be activated by Telecom service providers. Theres not much difference in display as well. All in all XR rules,2610291723,18536
I had taken the phone but the phones holds too many defects and issues. When we talk the mouth pice is not that precise to hold you voice creaky the voice is not audible if the phone is even partially away from your chin/mouth.,2610149147,18536

"Using around a week now. It’s snappy fast. Power efficient. Gives a back up of a whole day on average use. It has a single but impressive rear camera. Selfie camera is excellent. Low light performance is average though. The phone is bulky, Heavy, weighing more than 190 grams. You surely need to use a protective case to protect Camera bump and glass on both sides. Display is crisp.",2610116082,18536

VERY POOR PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER CARE.i bought it and received it on 3.10.2019 and noted a crack on right top corner of display which was visible when the plastic sticker was removed and complained to amazon customer cell on 4.10.2019. they assured a replacement. nothing happened. when i called them a number of times, they simply tranfer my calls to diiferent sections and then assurinng call back and then not calling back. Apple says it is the duty of amazon to take measures for replacement. Still left nowhere with my money gone on a damaged product.",2610029942,18536
Extremely easy to use. Good specifications.,2610015430,18536
Best iPhone I’ve used. Sold my one plus 6 and got this one. The screen is not an OLED so you miss out on deep blacks and saturation. But I noticed the colours are better than the older iPhones with LCD. It also has thick bezels which take some time to get used to. An OLED screen on this would’ve been wonderful but apple being apple wont do that!,2610013809,18536
Poor Front camera cannot take photo with light at background (photo attached),2609996701,18536
"This is my first phone from Apple. I was in confusion in buying between pixel and iphone. Even though pixel is far superior than apple in all departments, I went for iphone due to craziness. The product is well packed and delivered. When I started using the phone, the screen looks average, battery is good and the hardware seems good. The camera disappoints me al lot. Never expect this from Apple. In particular, the front camera is worst, in indoor lightning conditions and can see dots in image like a VGA camera.  At a cost of 60k, I was more so curious about the camera. It disappoints me badly. Even my motorola camera works well. If you are crazzy for the brand, go for it. Else definitely, you can go for other models in the market.",2609978009,18536
This Appario seem to be a fraud. My shipment has been smartly tampered and the have managed to overcome the security features. Even iPhone package back label have been tampered. Amazon Customer Care on phone or Twitter is of no help. I need to return this and get a replacement.,2609922634,18536

"Like every time, Apple has again mesmerised me with it’s great creation iPhone XR. The best part in this is when you unbox your brand new iPhone. It comes with an earpod, and a Fast charger. I understand that the price might be a bit high but trust me, it’s worth it. The camera has the best feature within it. Everyone says that it’s an LCD screen but you’ll nit be able to differentiate just by looking at the screen. The phone performance  is more faster now. And last but not the least, I am really impressed with the battery back up time. It really lasts. Full charge at 10 am and then the whole day on Cellular Data, I have played PES2019, played some songs from YouTube Music, hovering on Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook and clicked some good photos. When i came back home at 11 o’clock, i still had 66% charge. That’s what we needed in an iPhone.",2609904744,18536
iPhone XR is excellent there is no doubt about this. This first time my iPhone experience. Its great experience. But I am very unhappy about the dual sim performance (May be solved the problem).,2609896696,18536
Been a iPhone user always. Upgraded to iPhone XR from iPhone 6 and I have no regrets. Just love the ease that face recognition brings in... freedom that 128GB memory brings in... and of course peace of mind that Apple brand name brings in.,2609877365,18536
the phone wont turn on,2609872765,18536
"A lot of criticism of iPhone XR has been about its inability to take portrait pics of “only human faces!” Though true, it can be very easily overcome by downloading a software app - “Halide!” That and the near negligible difference in viewing experience, puts it on par with iPhone XS and even XS Max! Just go for it— the 256 GB storage version!",2609855722,18536
Prices have fallen by rs 10000 in 3 days after I bought my phone. I feel terrible.,2609810925,18536

 Iphone is good but probably I have received a defective piece from amazon as I am facing issues with software. Further never heard a iphone to be hanging issue but I am facing the same and attached a video regarding it. Within a month I have to visit customer care and still facing issues.

Has many drawbacks. Apps developed for iPhone by Indian Companies aren’t good at all. You can’t even do a normal Tatkal booking as irctc app unavailable. No dual Whatsapp so one number is wasted. No dual Facebook as well. Maximum 5gb cloud backup storage limit. Apps get refreshed more frequently and better enhancements on android. No features to search apps easily. Wifi once disconnected loses auto join features. Maximum 100 call records that’s very very annoying. Difficult to set primary and secondary sims in sms. Some Whatsapp features missing.,2609684200,18536

I would regularly charge the phone overnight one night, then go to bed at midnight with 55-60% left the next night, leave it unplugged, and finish the next day at midnight with around 2-5%.

"I’ve been using Android for close to a decade and now decided to check out iOS. Thanks to Amazon Prime Sale, got iPhone XR for a discounted price(Still expensive), Coming to the iPhone itself, after using phone for 3 days, below are the points I came across.",2609360733,18536
Using this phone since 2 months. Here is my review. Hope you will find it useful.,2609328806,18536
"I was skeptical looking at some XR reviews and also purchasing an iPhone off Amazon (previously always bought through Apple Stores). However, so far happy with what I have. The delivery was fast (on Prime, next day); all original packing (phone box) and phone is working fine. Touchwood - no issues. The Deal was good with the 10% additional HDFC discount. Go for 128 GB (or even higher) - the few extra thousand are worth it when you run out of space.",2609307480,18536
I got a defective iPhone XR. The screen is defective. There’s a blue shade on all the four sides of the screen. The phone’s working completely fine though.  So whoever purchased the phone while unboxing please check your device thoroughly. It was my mistake that i thought that maybe it’s something related to software which will be fixed after software update but it didn’t. And in that belief i skipped my 10 days return policy as well. I still don’t blaim amazon because i have purchased my Airpods from them as well. But still appario should not sell defective products to customers. Now i have to go through a hassle of getting the screen replaced from service centre and for that service centre will keep my phone for at least 7-10 days. It’s disappointing that i have to go through all this for a brand new phone. The reason why i didn’t upload a pic is bcuz it will not be visible in a pic taken from another phone.,2609294142,18536
ALL good,2609290996,18536
" I chose iPhone XR over x. The reasons are, it is 6.1-inch display and supports dual sim. the Battery Durability longs last. I got the Brand New peace (made in 2019, September) without any defect.",2609289056,18536
"During the great India sale, I saw this model on offer and my sister was dying to get a new phone since her old phone was barely keeping up. I finally made up my mind,, arranged the funds and got it for my sister.",2609287485,18536

Hello friends!! This is my honest review after using it for almost 2 months. I was using android since last seven years but then I decided to go for iPhone. Here are the pros and cons according to me which I have felt after using it for almost 2 months,2609247850,18536
So upgrading from 6S+ to XR. First reactions:,2609231659,18536
Everything look good but I never expect.,2609229875,18536
"Upgraded from 5s to xr after 3 years of 5s use. Purchased it at ₹37999 after low battery issues with 5s. Why I choose xr rather than iPhone 8 ,7 or even 6s even when I bought 5s after 3 years of its initial launch is",2609216741,18536
"Before I start this review I’ll let you know, I love the Apple brand and I’ve never used a 1080p OLED phone in my life (This screen seems perfectly normal to me). That being said I’ll dive into the review. I got this phone on the Prime day sale and I’ve been using it for almost a month now and here are my thoughts about this phone.",2609163970,18536
Got this product in the amazon flash sale and got a decent discount. Have been using the device for a few days and can certainly say that this iPhone has the best battery life till date. Phone lasted for almost 30 hours with heavy usage. The face recognition has certainly been improved from iPhone X. The only thing I dislike about the phone is the Screen Quality. You won’t find any major difference in the screen quality unless and until you stream Netflix or watch YouTube. Overall I feel this is one of the best iPhones apple has launched.,2609112737,18536
You will always feel cheated after buying an iPhone. It will get cheaper by every next 2-3 months.,2609107328,18536
"I have been using this phone for a while now. When I decided to buy this phone I checked on negative reviews first and after buying thought of using it first and then give a feedback. This is the perfect Phone with all advanced features for a normal user, which is worth for the price. Moving unto the flaws seen on the feedbacks, most of them complaining about the display being low resolution and LCD. In my opinion you won’t spot any difference with other iPhone displays. Another thing I’ve seen than lot of people complaining about the single camera, however, the picture quality you get will amuse you.",2609091967,18536
"Bought this during Prime sale. I love to use Apple products because of its simplicity. I was using iPhone 6 and thought of updating. While the XS and XS Max are more than a Lakh in India, iPhone XR is bang for the buck. The prime day deal was more sweet and surprise to me. The operation and touch responses are silky smooth. Dual Sim with the eSIM works like a charm. Rear camera is awesome with face detection AI Bookeh in Portrait mode. Screen resolution is very good and crisp without any pixel issues. It lacks 3D Touch but Apple incorporated Taptic Engine which will be updated to replace 3D Touch functionality eventually (though some are present now, it is limited). Some APPs are not good in the notch area though but it is ok to manage. Overall a nice update.",2609071894,18536
Received the product next day only but packaging was not good as it is a cellphone box they should cover it with some thing  Phone is working fine but some times apps automatically closes I am a bit confused if it is a genuine product or not  I would suggest people not to buy from amazon you should go to your nearest store and buy it,2609062898,18536
I am a recent convert from Android. I have used Samsung and Xiaomi phones earlier. Here is my initial impression:,2609049841,18536
"Don’t get swayed by some lame reviewers on YouTube. If u r holding out for an iPhone purchase then this is the real deal. The Xr is a jack of all trades although not excelling in any. The A12 Bionic is a beast,n’uff said already, the stereo speakers sound sweet and battery life is great. I found the most bashed about lcd display very pragmatic for everyday use.The portrait shots taken with the camera look a stunner.With the reason price cut , this has turned out to be the VFM iPhone ever made",2608931601,18536
Received product yesterday and product looks perfectly awesome.,2608920754,18536
Excellent phone. I am using it since 3 months. No problem. Classy product. Bought during Diwali sale @39k. Excellent battery backup lasting more than a day. Mind that I am a heavy user. Excellent photos. SIRI works well. No issues faced. Must go for it over other Chinese product in this price segment.,2608889237,18536
Iphone not working since I opened the box. Apple support of little help. Amazon not taking the return. Asking for a report from Apple. Now I have to chase Apple to get a report. Nightmare starts when you buy from Amazon.,2608872986,18536
There are many pros about this phone which you must be already aware of . I would like to point out at cons,2608871893,18536
Face ID and front camera portrait mode isn't working just after 3 months of purchase. It must be a problem of true depth sensor. My city (Imphal) apple servicing centre doesn't allow me to take for servicing and tells me to go to Guwahati (Assam) for this problem. May be a coincidence because this problem happened when I used amazon basics 10w fast wireless charger which I combine with xiaomi quick charge 3,2608811428,18536
I was using iphone 6 since last three years before switching to Iphone XR. The following are the things that impressed me the most.,2608736725,18536
Camera superb,2608730286,18536
I bought this iPhone XR from October Amazon Great Indian Festival at deep discount. At Rs 38000 after all discounts were applied was a WOW deal. THANK YOU Amazon.,2608712419,18536
"Nothing can beat iPhone. This is my fourth phone (iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 8 and now this) purchased from Amazon. All are excellent phones. Except for screen resolution, iPhone XR is nothing less than XS or XS Max. In fact, the battery life is twice as that of iPhone 8. Face recognition is excellent even in dark while android phones lack this technology. White is a beautiful color. Delivery was before scheduled deadline and in good external packing.",2608583233,18536
"I was bit worried about the authenticity of buying iphone online with unknown seller and by paying huge amount ,I took the  Risk but i would say amazon and seller  has done a wonderful job ,i checked the product  in apple website and its a genuine product with 1 year warranty..iphone is iphone with best processor,camera ,good battery life ,good for gaming and with  regular  updates from apple ..",2608551237,18536
It’s a very awesome mobile. Overall it’s really good. Hats off to apple that they provide these kinda of awesome products.,2608531902,18536
The iPhone XR goes blank the next day!!!,2615328548,18537
"Was sceptical at first. But after I received the phone it’s good and in mint condition. I am upgrading from iPhone 7 and it’s worth it. My iPhone 7 was 3 years old, and was lagging before I took the leap. Camera is more like the android phone with some Chinese lens I think. Battery life is so soothing! Face recognition is like butter. (Don’t know what will happen in the future) best part upgrading is the screen  size. Totally worth it. Videos are a bit dull but for the cost it’s worth it!! Thank you amazon for not sending a duplicate phone.",2615319820,18537
Well after buying this iPhone i am never switching back to android.,2615071084,18537
In two months the phone got destroyed its screen is filled with water its ip certification is nil bloody ios.....,2615061436,18537
Battery quality is worst I have honor 8c and it gives 2 days backup and this phone last only 12 hours with medium usage no fast charger takes tradatitional 3 hours for full charging if u want to waste your money then go for it if u r not brand conscious buy other brands phone with much more better  configurations that too almost half of its price,2615042085,18537
"Their is No earpods no lightning cable or connector in that box and will call after few minutes it blanks the call,not even a bip. Kindly give me some suggestions to rectify that",2614926546,18537
"Got it for 38k during prime early access, one of the best purchase for value of money is considered. iOS 13 future releases might make it even more snappier and battery consumption efficiency. Played WOW Blitz in 60FPS and found no issues. Will post the PUBG and Fortnite review in few days. Battery back up is about 6hrs screen on time for apps usage scenario.",2614908950,18537
"I ordered this phone on Diwali offer. The phone which I got first had display issue , so I got replacement for that.my previous phone was iPhone 6 Plus.  After one week of using this phone, these are my honest review.  Firstly the phone has excellent battery life . For average use, the battery lasts more than a day easily. Although charging takes time ie about 2 to 3 hours from 10% to 100%. As I am used to iPhone home button, I’m feeling a bit uncomfortable with this phone as it has no home button. You have to swipe up every time from bottom to top to unlock the phone. It has no finger print sensor . So it’s a bit difficult to unlock while ur in bed as u have to put ur face in front of the phone for FACE ID. Reach ability is an issue if u use one handed. Especially while using Facebook, when u have to swipe down from bottom line to make ur finger reach the top screen clicking options. Display of the screen is a bit below iPhone 6 Plus. So all in all the phone is just about satisfactory.",2614898939,18537
Good at 52k (the price at which I got the phone). The phone wasn’t worth 76k when it was launched but at 52k it justifies itself.,2614835903,18537
"I have bought it during prime sales , aside from discount i have bought it by paying just 36k",2614832973,18537
"It's the latest offering from I phone. Simply great. Camera is superb. The glass back looks ultra premium, though I would suggest you to get a back protective case as glass is fragile. Got it in white and had to pay 1400 extra but it looks the best in white. You are spending 60000 on a phone so what's 1400 more to get the best",2614828874,18537
"Fantastic mobile. Nicely integrated hardware and software nothing ever comes close to an Apple product. Smooth touch no lag, face identification works well. Camera is good. Battery lasts for 24 hours with moderate usage. Superb audio and video quality and iOS updates are always smooth. The apps are wonderful.👍Amazon delivery was on dot. the same offer is available at authorized reseller stores which happens around the time Apple launches a new version of iPhone.",2614823122,18537
IPhone SIM CARD SLOT NOT WORKING right from the beginning.,2614822735,18537
"Dude i was confused first that which one i should buy oneplus 7pro or iphone xr, so i choosen xr for 40k on offer and every thing ia good but i am dissapointed with tha camera quality and display quality really i have iphone 7plus also but the display is far far better then xr and the camera is also better but i know iphone 7plus has dual camera and that's ok but dude detailing is missing and also zooming is also missing we get digital zoom which reduces tha quality....",2614526698,18537
"In my initial review, I said that the iPhone XR was the best iPhone for most people right, and my thoughts about it haven't changed six months later. This is still the best iPhone in the market, offering the same smooth and terrific user experience as the more expensive iPhone XS and XS Max, but with the knowledge that you're also getting the best battery life. In fact, the battery life is at par, if not better, to what the P30 Pro and the Galaxy S10+ offer and that's saying something.",2614525114,18537
"I am facing cellular network issue with every new update. As per my understanding, Hardware is not compatible with the OS.",2614521944,18537
I have purchased this Apple iPhone XR (64GB) - Black for my use.,2614506044,18537
"I got it during great Indian festival for 38,000rs. Great value for the price.",2614499477,18537
it has a receiver failer problem,2614479975,18537
It was my first iphone till date i was an android user . But believe me once you get over these phones you wont switch it away,2614474540,18537
iPhone XR is still a great buy. The price VS performance ratio on this phone makes it a very sensible buy. If you don’t care about the latest and greatest this one year old offering from Apple is a far better buy. Only down side on the phone are as follows:-,2614455966,18537
"Never thought about purchasing XR but couldn't stop myself when i saw this deal . Taken sudden decision and bought this. Very much worried till the delivery suspecting that the product would be refurbished or duplicate. But amazon kept thier commitment, i received a brand new orginal iphone.",2614405595,18537
"First of all the Face ID is crazy fast and accurate even during pitch darkness. The phone is fast and smooth, you don’t feel like you are having just 3Gb of RAM, it handles anything you through at it without a hitch. The phone does feel premium and at the same time delicate because the backside is glass,”as you know glass is glass and glass will break”. The pictures taken from the camera are good but the lack of night scape sort of things is a con. Overall the phone is great, although the side bezels are thick, you get used to it. The LCD screen does not lack anything compared to the OLED’s in day to day usage. You just stop thinking those things when you are using daily.",2614388659,18537
I was looking to upgrade from my iPhone 6 and was confused about iPhone 11 & iPhone XR. Decided to go for iPhone XR just from the cost perspective. Only from Camera and Processor POV there is an upgrade in iPhone 11 rest remains the same.,2614336005,18537
Bought it for 45k during sale,2614276024,18537
"I had been using iphone 8 plus before and not a single time did I ever experience that phone heating up even after extensive usage. This piece however heats up to the extent making it uncomfortable to hold. If I use it for less than 10 mins, it works fine but any usage beyond that makes it hot. And on top of that, if the brightness level is set to max, its becomes an iron box(pun intended). Not expected off an apple device !",2614199747,18537
"the screen has a slight dot at the bottom which i noticed while fixing guard. If it comes out as mfr defect apple will certainly fix it. but doesn't seem serious, will take to apple while it is still in warranty to know more and update.",2614182944,18537
Got the 128 GB model since an iPhone almost always run out of space and never have the option for an SD card like Android devices.,2614163220,18537
"Overall the product is good from face id to Liquid retina. One thing surely standout for me is its surrounding speakers, they are really good(as per my experience), i got impressed With the work they have put in speakers. Sound is loud and clear.",2614158086,18537
"M an iphone addict... my first was iphone 4, then 6 which my brother gifted me but this time i upgraded to xr with my own salary n m really happy ... specially the battery life.... and  As i dont use camera much so potrait mode is not of much use to me.. face id recognition very nice... though u dont get the feel of holding iphone as it little bit big and on bulky side as compared to my iphone 6.... rest fuctioning everything is smooth so i think its worth the purchase... and if u have iphone 6 or 7 than only go for upgrade as i did lot of research and 8 and xs and xr they almost similar except for few features....",2614071111,18537
"I am more or less stuck with the iOS platform because of the iwatch since I love its functionality. Upgraded from my 3yr old iPhone 7, was actually waiting for prices to drop post September this year  but when Amazon came up with an unbelievable prime deal, I couldn’t resist!",2614065578,18537
"Easy to use, serves the purpose. I was an android guy for like last 7 years before that was using blackberry in between switched to ios as i used iphone 5c but at that time i was a bit disappointed may be because quite young i was and a bit techie but now i use my phone for basic purposes like calls, whats app, email, social media n bit gaming n music so it really handles that well though i was a bit hesitant at first as i was used to of finger touch sensor but seriously face recognition is damn good it works like a charm even when there is no light, so if you want no nonsense stuff n if it suits your requirements then go for it as now a days even droids are equally expensive in-fact some are more expensive like fold, razr etc. so just listen to your heart and buy ios or android and you wont go wrong, though i got mine in an offer for ₹43000 for 128 GB variant",2613981220,18537
"Purchased this phone for a friend and he is very happy with the performance of the phone. Camera quality and features are the industry standard. For anyone refraining from buying an iPhone because it has only a single SIM slot,  please be informed that this Phone does support Dual SIM if you use E-SIM. Airtel and Jio, for now, has E-SIM facility. For a more detailed review do visit my review website at excitedneurons(dot)com",2613978049,18537
"Awesome product !! Far better than spending almost double for Xs, XS MAX, 11 as the difference is only display and camera. Otherwise everything is same. It would be definitely a bigger upgrade if anyone is switching from iphone 8 or 8+ to it. The entire UI is different. Icing on the cake is the PRIVACY, its the utmost priority of Apple it seems. Without you face id, nobody can see even the notifications. Its a must buy product.",2613874474,18537
"I still don’t understand why people are crazy about iPhone. I bough this phone for 42k in great Indian sale couldn’t find much difference so for. It’s been a week now. My old android is doing all the operation faster then this which detected my face quickly. And that has fingerprint support also. I am also crazy about this phone. My friend told that he will never go back to android again. That’s the one reason for me to buy this phone. Let me wait for one more month to become addicted.  Till then I’ll leave the rating to 4*. When you think that this phone is expensive, that’s proving that this phone is for royal customers :p. Go for it if you are affordable.",2613840993,18537

"The iPhone XR is by far the best that Apple had to provide in the recent years with no doubt. Right from the camera to its horsepower battery backup, everything is top notch.",2613712926,18537
I bought XR after 11 came out. I read a few articles and saw a few video reviews which said that the real difference between the phones was the camera and that it was negligible and not worth the price difference.,2613653239,18537
"My Opinion-I don't know why people are saying it's an excellent display, personally i don't like the display at all, No doubt colour accuracy is good, Touch response is good, but it not that sharp, text looks blurry.",2613582594,18537
"I've been using my iPhone XR for over 10 months now. So far, everything's hunky-dory.",2613526121,18537
"Thanks to amazon for giving it for great deal, iphone xr 128gb is absolutely fantastic, with good battery life, camera, and performance. Since 6 months waiting to upgrade from 6s, compare to 6s xr a bit bigger in screen size for me apart from that its a great device to use, thanks to the seller 3 years back got 6s from the same seller and it still works pretty well without any issues.",2613504475,18537
"I love this phone... especially since I wanted it for a long time... would recommend it for both apple owners and those looking to become iPhone owners...camera quality is amazing... was able to activate the esim without hazzels.. 2 reasons that I switched my old phone for...size was a concern initially since I was accustomed to only iPhone 5, SE, 6... lightning cable is a disadvantage  with this phone as the charging point n headset points are the same... but I knew it when I was getting it... so got used to it now",2613476002,18537
I believe firmly that this is the Best Affordable Phone Apple has ever made!!!,2613359949,18537
"Battery life will surely amaze the buyer, I use to charge my iPhone 7 Plus at the 100 percent to my office at 10AM  and while returning by 7 PM it used to be approx 7-8 percent remaining. I use my phone for basic tasks and PUBG during break. Now when XR came to my hand the very first day I forgot to charge my phone to 100 percent and took it to my office at 62 percent. Amazingly it had 33 percent charge while I was leaving my office and I even played 3 evoground matches of pubg that day during my break. It was my dream to have long lasting iOS enabled devices which came true with this spectacular device. One should blindly go for it if performance and battery is your huge concern.",2613346311,18537
Wow Wow Apple iPhone XR Looks Amazing In Stunning White Colour Thanks To Amazon For Giving For Best Price In The Market Love You Amazon For Quick Delivery But Packaging  Is Not That Great It Should Be In More Secure Packaging  When Comes To Phone After 8 Years I am Using Again iPhone Before I Used iPhone 4s Now Again Coming Back From Android Phones To IOS Makes mee feel Happy And This Phone Is a beast go for it .,2613284092,18537
"I was always an iPhone user  till 8+ , then thought of changing to note 8 I loved that phone too but over the period of time I started realising there is nothing like IOS and iPhone. After using two high end androids (i keep changing phones) I witched back to iPhone and OMG I must say it has even become better it is so smooth like a butter on pan and IPhone X r is beauty, Liquid Retina is awesome and beautiful will not make you miss oled also the battery back up is woooowww .  This is the first ever phone I bought thru AMAZON I was skptical but thought of taking risk and yes Amazon delivered what they promised thru FREEDOM sale got a very good deal for 128 gb everyday I fall in love with this phone ..",2613270135,18537
"6.1 inches screen for a phone is pretty good, feels heavy, but all that pales in comparison after the actual features of the phone are unlocked.I was informed that phone can be tracked even when switched off as per the new ios 13 update, camera quality is better , both front and back , fast charging too is great, i like the idea that the body is aluminium made as compared to the latest which after checking and reviewing holds up better after drop tests, face id recognition is great, but need back up in the form of app lock for unauthorized usage.Overall a great phone, at a amazing price, do not miss the chance to buy it, even if you feel it is heavy on your wallet, you wont get such a good phone loaded with features else where.Its like how the iphone 7 was the benchmark for future models , same goes for this phone.",2612997488,18537
"Excellent deals offered by Amazon 38k after bank discount.......best iPhone for every aspect.......good camera ...... battery backup excellent......... looks elegant.....feels premium in hand.....and  one think i said to all , though it's a 720p display but display is excellent quality.......there is no panicked about it....and also played 1080p video in YouTube.......so .....go for it.......this is best budget iPhone at this price point......thank you Amazon........",2612993529,18537
I bought 128g  at 57k performing much faster and more smoother experience on an iPhone. Battery life is above average. app switching is lightning fast.,2612975726,18537
I love it,2612965291,18537

"Top end model IPhone XR with the Price of 42k😎 Extremely satisfied... I was an android user for 6yrs and this was my first upgrade to iPhone.. Battery Standby is just next to impossible in any smart phones these days, Face ID fab!(One dis - If I covet half of my face during bike riding, it doesn’t recognise me😂)",2612894400,18537
"Good phone. Go for it if you want an iPhone experience. Truth be told, I do miss a finger print sensor. But, at updating to iOS 13 the performance of the Face ID head become significantly faster.",2612886539,18537
"I will not recommend anyone to buy XR,if you are considering iphone from camera perspective.",2612884554,18537
"There is nothing to dislike about this phone. I forgot Android after using this. This is superior class,u ll feel it when you hold it. Don't be a sad face for 3GB Ram, it's better than 8GB Android. Facelock can recognize you in dark. There is no finger print scanner. But still it's no issues",2612876856,18537
First of all got it for 38000.  Great at this price but or maximum at 45k nothing more than that for this phone.,2612876009,18537
I was previously a user of iPhone SE and was wonderstruck with its abilities. But due to battery life had to look at a changeover. However looking at the price was little suspicious whether the phone would be worth for the money. Here are the pros n cons...,2612874063,18537
"This phone is good , i got it at Rs.45000 during this diwali sale, but after using this i was bound to think on the various aspects : considering the Ram and ROM ( 3 GB and 64 GB ) in this case , is the price ok , i felt that its really overpriced, we can get more features in Phones like Redmi Note 8 pro which is priced at around 16K ( discounts and bank offer are separate) this means we are paying for brand name or goodwill price simply to Apple. Then why we are not going for One plus models made in china as Apple i phone is also made in china for your information.",2612867037,18537
"This is my first iPhone after 10 years of being an android user. This review is after using this phone for 2 months. The performance has been top notch, battery life is very good considering  most of my days are moderate to heavy usage I still find 20-30 % battery the next day. Camera is good too but at time you miss the secondary lens for portraits and portraits don’t work on objects.",2612738803,18537
"I am writing this review after using this phone for more than 10 days now . I upgraded this phone from iPhone 7 . The phone is really good , worth a buy if its on good sale .  128gb - around 55k",2612664212,18536
"I am using apple from last 7 years. And never change apple phone frequently. I was using iPhone 6s from last 3 years but due to less space and batter backup, I need to upgrade it. I choose Apple iPhone because it's in between AppleXS and Apple X. Hardware A12 bionic chipset with 3 GB ram give my phone high speed on top of 128GB space thrilled the whole experience. In this new apple XR I still missed the center button especially when I play the games. Camera output is an amazing especially back camera. Also would like to appreciate the battery backup, I hardly change more than one time in 24hours. Now I do not need to my battery back always along with me ROFL.",2612577410,18536
The best decision that I took was to give away my Samsung galaxy S8 and get this phone. I was skeptical at first considering on paper specs and the obvious inferior display. But I used it in a retail store and I didn’t mind the display at all. It was one drawback that i could live with if i was getting everything much better than on the android side at the price range.,2612542876,18536
"Iphone is good. It dont have fingerprint reader, only faceid and password.",2612395817,18536
iPhone XR performs better than those specs that it showed in paper for XR.,2612372652,18536
A reasonably good product if you are into the Apple ecosystem and don't want to splurge.,2612359293,18536
"Looks great and behaves well too. Camera is quite good for its resolution. Excellent battery life. Thank god I got rid of my android phone, finally!",2612353914,18536
Gifted my wife with this phone for her birthday. Thanks to amazon for the fast delivery and maintaining their quality standards.,2612331074,18536
"iPhone XR with A12 bionic chip with 3 GB RAM is fast. This is my 1st iPhone and I am very impressed with it's performance, processing power is fast and iPhone is very easy to use and it fits in my hand very well.",2612256517,18536
"This is my first iPhone. I’m happy with the performance of XR. With hdfc credit card discount and exchange of old phone, it costed me 49.7k. Both front and rear Camera quality is great, battery lasts whole day with normal use. Face recognition is better than OnePlus 6T. XR’s almost HD display  can give tough competition to major FHD phones, side by side you won’t be able to spot any difference. Display is so crisp, no eye strain. And ios is buttery smooth. XR is more value for money than XS or X",2612243125,18536
Best mobile compare to other Apple mobiles,2612242453,18536
Awesome cellphone i have ever used..i have switched from Android(OP) to ios..which I believe..it cannot be compared with any os we have  in market..coming to the device it’s really awesome battery on an average use last for a day..i don not play any game..I mostly spend time on Twitter and on other apps...the only worst thing i find is the charging rate which really sucks...it takes appx an hour to full juice. Camera has been the best...not as good as of Samsung s series and note series  but for me its the best...face recognition works like charm...,2612240190,18536
Its Apple so no comments on their quality and user experience. Fabulous purchase got it at 43K which is worth and enjoying it,2612059879,18536
"Got this iPhone XR 128GB in an awesome deal of rs. 42,999 thanks to amazon.",2612029196,18536
"need i say anything about this phone! it's a bomb. i bought the product red 64GB varient and let me tell you its sexier than it appears in the pictures. camera quality is really good. the portraits are awesome even though it has a single lens. the bezzel looks a bit wide compared to XS and XS Max, but if you are upgrading from Iphone 8 Plus or lower you won't find it different. The liquid display is really nice with wide range of colors displayed really well. i got this during the independence day sale for Rs.52K and its definitely a great deal. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!",2612024741,18536
To review iPhone! Probably the only one I could afford but totally worth it.,2611999798,18536
"This is the best value for money you can get. iPhone 11 has only a marginal improvement compared to iPhone XR. But the performance is almost at par with them. I had an iPhone 6s, which ran almost 4 years. Touch and feel you get from your iphone is unparalleled with any other phone.(I have used all platforms)",2611973060,18536
"I bought a iphone XR  ,Which has some screen and camera issues  ,screen is freezing ,Amazon custome r Care talk like we did mistake ,not gud behaviour called to amazon ,they asked to go Apple store,already visited there from apple support we got information battery already replaced of this IMIE number.I told them ,but they were not agree,they again and again saying go there,we cant replace it.we just requested also said we paid 50000 for that but they dont agree,so if you buying pn and you have any issue in phone even it would be damaged they are not going to replace IT,and this seller is selling refurbish product.",2611921557,18536
"Great phone! Best ux in the class, no offense android but why does my calculator need permission to access my contacts?",2611912350,18536
"Not sure whether genuine product. Bought it on the first day of amazon sale. Within 15days, got a vertical line in the middle of display- see photos. Have bought 5 apple devices in the past and never had any problem with any of them so far. Since the return window closes within 19 days have to now take it to apple service center. Seriously makes me thing about the originality of the product.",2611874688,18536
Good phone. Great screen size. But apple still has not fixed low light shooting. It still looks like crap when compared to oppo or Samsung or the +one series. It’s incredible how we end up paying so much for an iPhone which still doesn’t get its camera right. Battery life is good. Downside is the replacement of the phono jack for headphones with its lightning socket which operates both charger and headphones - which means you can only do one thing,2611828983,18536
I just got my iPhone XR 128GB White phone. I feel am lucky to get 12% discount on MRP. In addition 10% discount on my Credit card. Also an 2% instantaneous cashback on a special day. Total paisa-vasool!!,2611828378,18536
Got it after discount for 43000+ additional value of 4000 on phone exchange.,2611789121,18536
"Feels like got robbed by apple I bought it for 64990 and after 10 days of launching iPhone 11 the price of this phone reduced to 54990 10000 drastic drop. Its bionic A12 chip is good and smooth but battery performance is bad, and it doesn't even have  Fingerprint sensor, the face detection wont work at all angles. Need to stop buying this apple product.",2611777180,18536
"The iPhone is a great phone, but I am really impressed with amazon. I recieved the phone in less than 36hrs and checked the warranty and coverage on the Apple website. Everything was right in place, turns out I was unnecesarily hesitant to purchase the phone online. Also got one year screen insurance free in addition to the heavy discount!",2611725131,18536
 My review after one month of use,2611480367,18536
Pathetic experience with this phone . Bought it for 60K and not worth the price . Assembled in China and lot many issues with battery and other features . Better to buy from stores which are assembled in India and are cheaper with better quality check . Learnt hard way to never but electronics from amazon .,2611476715,18536
"I hot this product with 37K during big billion sale  ,and the product is super but it is not for you if you are a camera freak . Back camera and front camera both are good but front camera night vision is not enough . Over all battery life is good . Potrait mode  photos also good (without having a dual back camera)",2611452648,18536
"Not gonna lie while I was transferring my iCloud stuff, the phone got heated up to the point where I had to switch it off and then start over again.",2611411491,18536
The best camera and feel of security...,2611400447,18536
"This is my 4th apple product. As usual, it’s apple works fine . Will easily can last upto 4 years. Battery- is just awesome, can last u full working day with heavy useage.",2611376806,18536
"My second iphone and 3rd apple product so i can clearly say that if you are the first time user of apple product then you will surely give iphone XR 5 star rating but if you have been a long run user then you will think twice to give even 4 star also to this, may be after demise of Steve jobs apple has compromised with its quality, where as in till 2015 there were no comparison with any phone with iphone but now few products are giving strong comparison to it, apple is now only encashing its name but it will not good for the future of apple because now a days consumers are more aware, and if you are not giving 5 star to iphone the. Probably you have dealt with a wring product, sorry but not completely happy with XR. May be i will think next time when i will be upgrading my phone.",2611330576,18536
Best battery life in an iPhone.,2611307060,18536

1.The battery life is good.,2611227279,18536
"I got a very bad product from Amazon. This was really not expected from Amazon. i don't know whether its an issue from Apple or Amazon. From the day it has come it started giving me issues.Issues related Hardware like Distorted sound i.e. Other person cannot listen the voice clearly, voice becomes like mute, and Software Issues like Phone getting hanged [NEVER HEARD IOS HANGING], Not able to unlock the phone moreover not able to recieve a call. I am the first time user to the iPhone and got this sort of bad experience which was never thought of or never expected.I am really disappointed with the product.Also I think Battery Life can be improved. Camera quality and Face reader is OK.",2611222016,18536
Thanks to Amazon for putting it on sale for 43K . Wonderful phone to have at such price . Battery life is perfect for heavy users . Although a double camera would have made it perfect.,2611184782,18536
Honestly speaking I love apple products due to the simple design and fluid user experience with the products. I am a fan of black but i got the Product RED as part of the amount goes for HIV research.,2611178583,18536
"This phone is just awesome. Screen is really good and bright, you can’t really make a difference between the screen and an AMOLED screen. I have compared them side by side. You can’t really say the difference.",2611163513,18536
Note: No fingerprint reader in the phone so please consider it as the review of face id.,2611157711,18536
"Received a faulty set, had to take it to a service centre within 2 months and they had to replace it with a new phone.",2619530219,18537
"Good purchase during the sale. I like it. Moved from 6 to XR, which makes it bulky in your hand. But i will get use to it. Battery backup is good. I love the photos clicked in Protrait mode.",2619487939,18537
"Good phone. Being a 1st time user of ios, i liked it a lot. Although the compromises made for this phone like inferior display, big bezels nd notch are cleary visible and annoying. Battery life is top notch although supplied 5 watt charger is a trash. Using my iPad charger to charge it fast. Camera gives dslr quality pics in daylight nd outdoors but night photos are below average. In total a good package to try out apple ecosystem.",2619473587,18537
"I purchased this phone from amazon during the freedom sale got it for an effective price 49k . This is my first iphone and honestly not regretting a bit . I was worried about the specs such as LCD screen and camera quality but it did not disappoint me this one camera on XR is 1000 times better than those Three cameras on my samsung A50 and the LCD screen hardly makes a difference its crystal clear and vibrant . The battery life is just beautiful it can stand for 48hours on a single charge . Overall it a good buy , Apple is never great with specs but the always kills it",2619444229,18537
The phone was not getting power on..,2619339460,18537
"It's a fabulous product. I'm sure everyone knows it's quality. Only one thing that I should mention here regarding the battery. I was definitely expecting a better battery life in the normal mode. It's merely giving a day with normal usage in that mode. However, in the Low Power Mode, its giving a great battery life without compromising any regular features of the phone.",2619289810,18537
"My experience with iPhones was never bad but this time with iPhone XR the phone started hanging from the very first month, it has not yet been a month and is already hanging.. did not expect this from apple gadgets. everything else is good the battery life , camera but its a little heavy, heats up and has started HANGING.",2619243818,18537
Since from a lot of months i have been waiting to buy an iPhone XR in great Indian sale and as more than I expected I bought this mobile for a huge price drop thanks to Amazon for that.I ordered on Saturday noon 1 Pm and I got the product on the next day early morning 7 Am a super fast delivery from Amazon.,2619241642,18537

The product is awesome i have brought the same in Sep & there has been no issues it’s currently running on IOS 13.2.2 & the phone is very fast it also has e-sim which is a major plus point face recognition is very good without any hassle & the battery is good enough to take it for a day & half. As this phone was bought after APPLE TV + was released we have received a annual subscription free with the product from 1st Nov 2019,2618806856,18537

"This is my third iPhone and I must say - each time Apple introduces an iPhone, they improve a lot in each model. iPhone XR is one of best selling iPhone for year 2018. Its not that cheap but still standout in crowd. Its not expensive than iPhone XS but still have all the features same as other top models- only difference is OLED screen but I can live with that. Recently introduced iPhone 11 and XR have only one difference which is of Price. Most of the features are exactly same. Best Battery backup ever in an iPhone I must say. Soothing and flawless iOS.  Camera is more than average and very much improved as compared to previous generations. Glass frame back and front and very appealing to eyes. Overall, a satisfactory experience with this device. A must buy if are considering iPhone 11 but have low budget.",2618780883,18537
"Fingerprint reader given one star coz it has Face ID 😂, it works lightning fast (even in the dark) , super build quality, battery backup is nuts (works for more than 2 days with decent use) , Camera quality is amazing for photography and videography. Preferred product over iphone X if screen quality is not the main thing to notice (doesn't matter if you don't watch 4K videos on youtube)",2618709736,18537
"Using an iPhone after 6 years. Have been using Android and the transition is bit difficult as I am used to having different functions. Happy with product, it is not as bulky as I assumed. Vibrant colour and smooth functioning. Delivery was also very quick.",2618703131,18537
Display 3.7/5 — but u will get use too it not too bad better than expensive android phones  (DONT BUY IF DISPLAY IS YOUR PRIORITY),2618655387,18537
Only face recognition and no fingerprint. I think the phone is very good. Screen could be little smaller However these days only big screen phones are being launched so lets wait for future.,2618629554,18537

"Phone not working. Phone was autotyping and then eventually frozen screen. I bought on 15th oct and barely used for few days. No support from amazon for replacement for defective piece. One thing to note that when I received this piece, it was in a locked bag. However, there should have been some QR code on bag which the delivery boy scans. There was no such code on the bag and the delivery center sent the qr code as whatsapp on my phone.",2618046742,18537
Indeed a great phone. After a month usage I can say following:,2618001277,18537
"While on call, if you want to see the screen, it takes time to turn on. So if you want to disconnect or add another call, frst you have to wait for the screen to turn on.. which is very irritating. One can’t even press the home button as it is not there in xr. Even aftr pressing power key, screen doesn’t turn on immediately nd pressing it twice results in disconnection of call. 😤😤",2617978939,18537
Thank u amazon for letting me hv this phone for under 40k. Everything about the phone is exceptional and for a change battery is excellent. Camera is good too and with dual sim capabilities the phone is sure a winner. The 11 is the same phone with just dual camera but 20k higher. So it didn’t make sense to buy the iPhone 11.,2617969985,18537
iOS 13 is a failed attempt from apple. The phone doesn't have a smooth wifi or network connectivity. Its worse than some other phones half the cost. Absolute disappointment. Even older phones like 5s and 6s don't show network issues while the iPhone XR has these issues. Apple support is clueless and can't solve the issue. Disappointed with this apple product. All else is good just that the phones connectivity which is the most important thing for a phone is atrocious. Avoid if u can.,2617936167,18537
"I’m very happy with this Apple product except call records. I didn’t find any app that suits my iOS XR in the store, rest everything works well.",2617864601,18537
"Everything on this XR works extremely well but the only problem that i have faced is that there is some kind of manufacturing defect in the camera lens.The photos shot have a black spot kind of smoky.Its only visible when something bright like sky or white wall is shot.Also,I’ve wiped the camera glass many times so it’s not on the camera but the inside lens.Guys,phone is quite good just be careful while purchasing can happen with anyone.",2617786777,18537
I have been using iPhone XR for about a week and I am impressed with the purchase and the phone has met my expectations. Here are some of the facts:,2617774001,18537
For: Great battery life for an iPhone,2617762503,18537
"Pros - good screen resolution, camera quality, battery back up is good. Good screen size.",2617737397,18537
"I purchased this phone (Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black) during the Amazone Deewali sale, working fine and no issues so far. Installation and configuration was pretty easy as my previous phone was also iphone. I have checked and verified the product and it is a genuine one. The convenience part  is copying contacts, photos , audio & video files took less than 2 min. In overall,  phone is  good and i got it for around 50K with a Credit card refund offer of 2.5k back after 3 months. But I didn’t receive the refund so far. Spoke to bank and they advised to get in touch with Amazon. Not sure where to reach now.",2617670220,18537
"I was a bit skeptical about buying it on Amazon. But happy to say..No regrets at all on this purchase. Works exactly as advertised. Absolutely no issues at all. Great battery life, nice photos. While the other variants of the latest iPhone have oled screen, this one has an lcd screen. But I don't think it is making a difference to me. The screen quality is excellent. Overall very satisfied with this purchase.",2617641010,18537
First time iOS user. Shifted from android to iOS finally,2617608745,18537
Reviewing the device after a months of usage.,2617605646,18537
Battery life 5 hour and heating too much...Amazon se na kharide phone Sayed discount ke Naam pe refurbished phone dete hain....iPhone me heating problem samanya nahi hain....mera phone change kardo amazonwale,2617586865,18537
"Nice phone got it for rs44000 after discount.with no cost emi from Amazon icici credit card. Red is beautiful. Battery back is good last for more than one day in my case. Performance, quality And finish awesome. Got update to iOS13. Amazon super fast delivery in 14hrs. Phone was covered with innovative tamper proof packaging and a code ,otp was provided to me by sms before delivery. Code to me matched with code on packaging.",2617575611,18537
There's no fingerprint sensor as its Iphone X series..face lock works good even in dark. Display is good fully visible in outdoors. Nice battery backup. Dual sim makes it awsome i.e one E Sim and normal one. May pay nominal fee for esim to operator. Currently only Jio and Airtel support esim..so please consider that.,2617574058,18537
I received this product with slight scratch on the camera edges. It can be easily noticeable and,2617561319,18537
My 1st iPhone. I liked it. Only difficulty I find is I didn’t get much variety Of cases and cover for this model. You have to use for hands to handle this phone because of its size and skin. I purchased it in sell at Rs 46k in Nov 19. I prefer volume keys to be in right hand side and music aux cable on top which makes a mobile easy to handle and operate,2617493950,18537
I had purchased the Mobile for Gift to My Son. When I started it on 23rd Oct I found that the some of the functions of the Mobile are not working. To my disapointment I could not return as it was not showing the option. The return period was valid but could not return.,2617482931,18537
I bought a Product Red iPhone XR in the Great Indian Amazon sale in exchange for my 3 year old iPhone 7. I got the 128 GB version for ₹ 40k.,2617465725,18537
Best value for money apple device right now got this iphone xr for 38k steal price totally worth it i am not an apple fanboy i use my oneplus 7 along with this device the softare smoothness is unmatchable camera is great and brand value is superb but main cons is slow charger it takes almost 3hr to complete the charge and display is also good but flat/accurate colours but i like the saturated one of my 1+ 7 but the quality is very nice closer to 1080 full hd panel for so under 45k is the best apple device you can get but if display is your main priority than oneplus 7t is a better overall device along with fast charging in this price range,2617463539,18537
I checked the IMEI with Apple once i got the phone and it is genuine,2617393493,18537
"Hi, i have purchased this phone on 27th sep,  as i am prime member so i got this product on 30th sep.  I have created apple i. D pass word..  Since morning the very next day of product received..  Today is 1st oct 2019.. In a single day..  Even not completing 24 hours..  It is getting hang..  And it took time to almost 4 hours to unlock my device..  Even though i was not able to unlock my screen",2617302529,18537
I have been using this Phone for about 5 months. I had used 5s and 6s plus. This phone is definitely a Big Big upgrade from former models. It’s brilliant in every possible way. The two main concerns which I had earlier with iPhones were battery life and secondary SIM card. I’m happy that finally Apple heard us and released this beast. You might wonder about thick bezels and LCD display on this phone. I bet you don’t notice them at all when you get along with this phone. No wonder why XR is the best selling smartphone worldwide. Battery life is excellent. Enough of reviews. Just go for it. You won’t regret at any point of time!,2617248405,18537
"A superb smartphone at this price range, bought k20 pro a few days back but wanted to get an iPhone, got it on the early prime member sale at an amazing price, everything is perfect, except for the camera which shows a yellowish pictures everytime rest of all battery, screen performance is what I needed the most and this didn’t let me down. Thanks amazon and apple for timely delivery and a best product",2617137184,18537
 Everything is awesome except battery.,2617063103,18537
This does not seem to be a genuine product. My phone goes completely silent many times and i have to restart it. The seller is not genuine. Better go for other sellers or offline.,2617049779,18537
"Really super experience,simply best quality,since 10 eyrs I used android and now feeling ios and iPhone quality,before I used Samsung S9plus which bought for 65k now it’s awailable for 28k means 25k worth product they sold for 65k.So my final  openion is shift to ios and iphone xr is value for money.",2617041969,18537
Best battery life amongst current iPhones...lightning fast with the most current A12 processor...specs are almost at par with the iPhone XS/XS Max...except for the camera and display. All in all...excellent price/value equation.,2617027762,18537
I purchase in amazon festive sale at 40000 which is great but if one buy under 50000 at that price also it is amazing,2616999119,18537
I'm regular Amazon buyer for many years now.Got my first iPhone xr delivered on 7/10/2019.But sorry to inform it stopped working from 21/10/2019.Amazon delivered Apple phone which is a most trusted brand in world.Dont know whose fault it is.I contacted Apple authorised service centre ie. Icare  who has d mobile to Bangalore.And now I'm waiting for their reply.My trust on Amazon is affected,2616975975,18537
Product is good what we bought from Apple store but what Amazon delivered is not good  I suspect this not good quality product Amazon delivered during sale  with in a month one day this iPhone abruptly went off ND I was not able to on it again,2616874771,18537
"Very beautiful phone...very long battery life, superb camera quality...thanks a lot Amazon for such great discount during prime day sale n for making it affordable ...very happy with my purchase😊😊😊",2616833533,18537
The phone is a little big and handling it single handed might be a problem but size matters ! The display and the face recognition is awesome,2616802981,18537
"Still now doing great . iPhone XR is a great phone , upgraded from iPhone 8+ , n i am totally satisfied. Yellow is a beautiful colour but the only con is the side bezels n aluminium frame colour.",2616750718,18537
Good battery backup so far. Little bit heavy compared to my previous version. Face unlock feature is a bit irritating sometimes as it gets unlocked sometimes when u don’t wanna do it,2616724065,18537
Well I’m writing this review after 3months of usage.,2616644377,18537
"Writing this review after 1 week of usage. Purchased the 128 GB version during the freedom sale for 57k. I was confused between One plus 7 Pro, IPhone XS and the XR and I must admit that it turned out to be a good decision. Its a classy product and feels premium in hand compared to other devices in this price range. The features that the other phones boast about are hardly being used in day to day life unless you are an avid gamer. The screen size is just perfect and quality is not bad as being highlighted in some of the reviews on youtube. Battery life is excellent, camera is very good and the phone is waterproof. Performance is excellent with A12 Bionic processor.",2616614116,18537
"I used to be an apple hater but no other phone ever matches the gaming optimisation of the iPhone XR/XS/XS Max. These devices with the A12 bionic chip just beat any other android devices in graphics rendering performance without a doubt. People have been complaining about the display that is basically 828p but trust me, you won’t even notice the difference between a proper 1080p screen and this one. In fact this screen looks better than most of the 1080p mobile phone screens (thanks to the liquid retina display technology it uses). The camera is amazing in all aspects and one of the best out there in the smartphone market but it can’t click portraits without detecting a human face (P.S. you can download an app named halide at the appstore to click non human portraits).",2616585232,18537
After 2 weeks of usages I am giving my review:,2616580673,18537
Very good phone but can be priced better as this can be considered as low in value for money otherwise,2616536444,18537
Best budget phone from Apple with better image stabilisation similar to iPhone XS. Battery life is extremely competitive with one plus battery's lifetime.,2616476141,18537
One of the best iPhone ever. Features are fabulous and battery life is excellent. On an average it lasts up to 10 hrs if you are an extensive phone user. This includes data usage and voice calling.  Bit heavy I comparison to other iPhones or android phones but might be that’s the trick it’s good on battery life. I’ll give 10/10,2616370028,18537
"The camera quality is not as good as I excepted it to be. It forms grams in the captures which is very evident when the pictures are projected on a monitor or a tv screen. Battery life is superb, goes more than 36 hours with normal usage until it hits the 20% low. Face recognition is perfect.",2616351262,18537
"Everything else is quite well except battery consumption which does not lie with the promised service that is upto 25 hrs of talktime (wireless) and upto 16 hrs of video streaming (wireless), at all.",2616347933,18537
"Hi, The device is good as it has everything what people look for in this price segment, i have used both i11 and XR , 11 is best because it has new processor rest XR is also a good option.",2616345306,18537
"I have received this product  on 1 Jul 2019, Since then i am experiencing difficulty with wi-fi Connections (taking some time to connect, not connecting spontaneously, not detecting other Wi-fi connections). Face ID not working properly (taking time to detect).  I was thinking Amazon sold the one of the damaged product. Very  bad experience with such a costly mobile ordered in Amazone",2616247649,18537
"Got.the product today, heating up very fast , and also not connecting to Android and other equipment. Not performing when trying to upload to cloud, etc. Connectivity issues.  Amazon says no refund , am in the.process of cancelling other buy orders.",2616198061,18537
"Was using X 64gb from last 2 yrs, apart from OLED display things are pretty much the same",2615971949,18537
Awesome...,2615968620,18537
"iPhone XR is brilliant perfect value for money phone giving all the specs of latest iPhone in a reasonable price. Packs the same display, screen & pixel density as iPhone 11 only difference being camera upgrade & A 13 bionic processor rest almost everything is same. Excellent battery life, display in iPhone XR. The White Colour looks simple, sober & classy unlike dull creamy white in XS or XS Max last year. All in all a very good phone & thoroughly satisfied with it.",2615958595,18537
This phone really feature-rich.,2615949717,18537
Terrific Purchase. Initially there was a heating issue while updating software but it has gone now and working excellent.,2615873938,18537
"Coming from iphone 8, i really didn't need this upgrade..but believe it or not..i am flattered..got a stellar deal of 40k for 128GB..camera is good from iphone 8..overall still it can't beat my other beast Samsung Galaxy S10 plus..but here is the cliche..an iphone is an iphone.",2615832771,18537
I was worried that it will be little oversized with 6.1 inch but fits well . Battery backup is good one full charge keeps it running for 1.5 days . Not tested camera yet . Got it in very good deal at 46k . Blue colour looks good.,2615826465,18537
"Third class screen and resolution, Very poor outdoor visiblity, network issue with dual sim, wifi drop/speed issue, slow data/ltr issue...slow charger included which takes ages for full charge...",2615658723,18537
I am writing review after two months of usage.,2615643368,18537
Great battery life. We're getting a battery life of almost upto 2 days now.,2615576658,18537
"I was skeptical at first. Some people mentioned that they received fake of defective products. In my case, the product is genuine. I checked it’s serial number on Apple website too. There is no difference in performance compared to people who bought from stores.",2615550604,18537
What do I say about it. Night vision of camera is not at all good. Battery literally gets drain if we use mobile data for longer time. Yes but I have to admit if we do not use mobile data or wifi battery life is longer. Face recognition is not as fast as I was thinking compare to other brands with same features. But I loved my iPhone regardless of all this little issues.,2615441048,18537
"All the performance is good with all working features. and the main point was the battery backup of the phone it will minimun 1 and 1/2 day and another amazing think is i got no heating in this phone while i playing games like pubg mobile,cwc2 etc.Also a measure think is there is no comparison of ios with android. IOS is best in his performance.",2615415125,18537
"Overall its a good product, battery backup is little bit good compared to other iphone models.., Camera is Okay but i have seen mostly noise in the photos.Sound quality is as usual awesome, and I didn’t tried underwater test but tried splash test, it’s  up to the mark upon splash proof....I am using it since last 3 months I didn’t face any problem...Go 4 It👍🏻",2615329362,18537
Switched to iPhone XR from MI A2,2623769760,18538
Amazon people are least bothered after giving a defective product.Such a costly product and i wonder how they can give such a defective Apple product and the customer has to run around with that.Amazon will ask to contact Apple support center and submit it there. and if you contact Apple customer care they will ask to contact Amazon. it just goes around like that.After submitting to Apple now amazon people are relectuent to take it back... its been 5 days without any solution...Please don't buy iphones from Amazon...Worst experience...,2623720815,18538
Its been one week since i bought it. I am completely satisfied with the product. Screen is quite big. Only and only problem is with the Charger. It takes 3 hours to charge the phone to 100%. Otherwise everything else is worth the price we are paying.,2623624555,18538
I bought this iPhone XR in the Great Indian Sale from Amazon. Product was perfectly delivered and on time. Buying from amazon is safe and you get genuine products always.,2623618081,18538
Guys i wud suggest u all to not buy the phone from the site as the one I have received is nt in its best condition..it’s sensor is nt working properly n it hangs too at times n I have just received the phone just 15 days back,2623523687,18538
I had never used an Iphone before and I was always sceptical about going for an IOS from android but after using this phone all I can say is IOS is on par with android.,2623520271,18538
It is my red beast.... My first iPhone experience with iPhone xr is very smooth and awesome... I got is at only 38K many many thanks to amazon for this. Battery performance is good... with normal usage it gives around 24hrs backup while with heavy usage 12-13 hrs backup u can definitely get. But charging adapter  in the box is very pathetic. I just ordered an 12W fast charger at 1K from amazon. It is a smart choice to get iPhone Xr at 40K over iPhone 11 at 59 K (Including HDFC bank offer). With your saved money u can buy different apple accessories. Overall my first iPhone experience is awesome.,2623433477,18538
This is my first iOS,2623365709,18538
"Not even completed 1 yr of this product and price reduced drastically. How you can decrease the price to such extend. I need compensation for that, amazon shall take necessary actions on it.",2623316503,18538
"got this for a superb deal, in fact way cheaper than mu prev 7plus which i got back in late 2016. Face ID works like a charm and the display seems great for normal usage.",2623189633,18538
"After 5 days of use,Love the IPhone XR Red ,Premium Top Class Phone,Got it For 38 k...Worth it...Camera Is Classy and Superb...With depth Control feature....Very Smooth...Display is good...Bit Battery is little low but compared with other iPhone it is good....Battery Standby is 10 hr when onscreen time is 8h 30m with always Data on with usage of FB ,YouTube and other apps. Face Unlock is so quick..Over all love to have this IPhone XR...Upgraded from IPhone SE to XR...So Battery is very much better for me...🥳🙏🏻",2623129999,18538
"This is my first apple product purchase, prior my mentality regarding the apple product was like a no Value for money company, but once I started using this phone the premium fell and the Sooth buttery flow type interface is way better than android. Happy to use this phone.",2623074814,18538
"Great phone. Not a gamer so don’t care about the hardware stuff. Not a pro photographer so any pictures I shoot are epic for me. Not a loud person, so speakers on low volume for me work just perfectly. Battery life should be great like most apple phones do. Display is soft to my eyes so I like that. Apple interface is the best, so nothing much to say about there.",2623028756,18538
Used for a day as of now. Awesome phone. Snappy and fluid in use. battery backup is pretty good (around 8 hours of screen-on time) with continouse data-on (youtube 1.5 hrs). Using 18W adapter which charges it fast. Brought 3.5mm jack connector to lightening separately. Rest all good. Will review after few more days. Thanks.,2622963809,18538
"I don't like the  features of iPhone XR after paying huge amount. It's battery is drained very fast . Side buttons are not comfortable while holding on hands, it pressed automatically without knowing . One-Two times it has automatically dialed the number when it was in my pocket. I think old version of iphones are  much better than this phone. I wants to return this phone but don't find any option in Amazon. Anyone please suggest how I can return it. I bought it 28 days before.",2622913578,18538
There is no fingerprint reader on this phone as its replaced by face recognition which works fine. User interface is same as my earlier iPhone which is excellent. Coming to battery life...it is simply amazing.,2622887964,18538
"Second time I shifted to Apple . But this time it was from One Plus 5T . Speed wise, battery wise, photo and video quality wise , fast charging , everything One Plus was better .  XR hangs also sometimes while receiving calls . But it was never the case with One plus .",2622804946,18538
"I received in original iPhone sealed package.  For its price, its best possible iPhone in market. Look and feel is great. Very fast responsive while using. Camera quality is 5-Star, Portrait pics are crisp clear. Watched some 4k and HDR videos on this iPhone, stunningly beautiful with tru color and deep contrast on this display. Its Amazing iphone, Thanks Amazon.",2622750907,18538
This item is faulty. Make a sure first .,2622724123,18538
Using this phone since last 20 days...first time iOS user...spending this much money not worth i have purchased @ 43000.00.purchased it because i have not used apple before...those who r buying it just because of Apple logo..pl don't go..those who r enthusiastic for technology must go for it...i m a simple user not very technical not very camera oriented...a simple redmi user..i m not saying phone is bad but doe those who don't have much usage with regards to its unique features should avoid this...,2622704287,18538
Amazing,2622678049,18538
"What is the main purpose of the Phone? To make and receive calls, right. This phone has a defective microphone so call quality is damn poor. You have to speak very close to the microphone for the other person to hear you. All other feature works quite well. As for photos, even Poco F1 takes better pictures. Applez just a brand as was Nokia and Blackberry once.",2622655150,18538
After using one month best camera and battery backup.,2622618586,18538
I browsed a lot about this phone all were saying it has a LCD display and which is older.,2622572482,18538
"Serious problem with the lower mic, after spending all that money in this faulty crap just after two months you finally feel that you are the biggest C* in India who is buying an iPhone. Fragile product, connectivity issue, software issue & restrictions  all the type of minor issues have been build up causing a serious issue. Think before you waste ya hard earned money. Apple products are degrading their quality to keep their stocks and shares up.",2622547309,18538
Good deal and worth buying for iPhone customers non iPhone user please don't buy as you will not find worthy but as a premium product its very good and feels better in hand superb quality,2622462109,18538
Bought it In white 64gb variant...looks are premium and has a large screen...being an lcd screen it far much better than other phones in competition...u get about 56gb of usable storage which is quite ok for a minimal user...performance is amazing and camera quality is average...must buy if you are looking for a budget iphone specially on offers,2622398934,18538
Well Apple products deliver quality and apple I phone xr is just another fine product I bought few days back which is their lowest model in iPhone x series. Well for the specs and lcd screen I really feel it's over priced that's reason it gets one star less.,2622396967,18538
"Happy with the phone, initially I was scared to buy as it is expensive, and reviews were making me go on doubt, but the product came in a good condition,phone is superb. Thank you amazon for fast reliable service",2622320797,18538
"I am giving this review after few months of use of this phone. Apple never disappoints you. As i have shifted from Google phone to Apple, was bit difficult to shift from android to ios but now i am used to it. So many hidden features which u can find it out from you tube. Camera is awesome. I also learned some extra tips for photography from youtube and it is awesome. The speed of the phone never disappoints you after loading full 64gb data into the phone. Overall phone is awesome.",2622285817,18538
It’s as good as buying from the store. The plastic cover which covers the box had a cut and small piece missing . Due to bad handling may be . That was disappointing to see. But then again the box was all sealed and it’s ok . Nothing to complain,2622230296,18538
I was more satisfied with my one plus 6T than this. Picture customization is not better than that phone. Without comparison it's ok. Battery life is good than other iPhones and the app size in store is very less compared to play store so even with 64 gb it's good.,2622192321,18538
This product is not adequate in terms of its quality & performance. It’s screen creates problems in eyes i.e. not comfortable for eyes. Very very bad product. Totally disappointing. Very very bad item delivered by Amazon. Heat problem is there with my iPhone XR. Amazon Sells fake iPhones. Not satisfied at all. This iPhone has also hanging problem.,2622144906,18538
I like the XR. This review is more for people who have yet to graduate to buying mobiles etc online. This was my first time. I had heard all sorts of stuff. But Amazon THANK YOU! Delivered in a tamper proof packing! With the assurance of a ten day window to return. The phone is working just fine!,2622095493,18538
"The accessories and the packing not at all good. I have used apple products, earlier packing and accessories are very good quality. Seems apple degraded the quality may be they have ordered from China. Not matching the standard of apple.",2622035985,18538
Very bad experience in this iPhone XR. There are so many issues in this phone like when I click on airdrop icon then phone freezes and I have to force restart to get it working.,2621997527,18538
"Quality at its best . You buy it and if you want QUALITY, with best user friendly interface and camera . List goes on . Its the best . That’s why u are here . Don’t think again and again . Click buy . You wont regret and yes u want it. 😉👍🏻",2621968426,18538
"Excellent choice from iPhone family , only sad they drop the price around 10k 2 months after my purchase. I missed the chance, lucky new customers.",2621656108,18537

This is my first iPhone. Though it’s too early to give any review about the phone  as I bought it recently but  till now I’m very impressed with iPhone XR. Go for it.,2621527769,18537
"Well, it has been more than 2 months now and the phone has been getting compliments. It's the first iPhone that I've bought and I should say that the money you're paying for the phone is mostly for the brand image.",2621496587,18537
"Can't believe I got this phone for Rs 36,000",2621357483,18537
I have bought it around a month back. Used it and then writing a review.,2621357456,18537
3D camera not working .. cannot setup faceid .. always displaying Face ID not available error neither front camera portrait working .. please help don’t have a clue where to go for help,2621329140,18537
The most positive aspect of XR is battery life in my usage of 6 months. Downside is weight especially if you are upgrading from iPhone 6 or 7. Quite heavy due to big battery. Make sure you upgrade to iOS 13 and use the feature to optimise battery charging for longevity of battery,2621325697,18537
"I upgraded from iPhone 6 which I had used for 2.5 years. For me iPhone XR seems super smooth with amazing speed. I am still getting used to the absence of Home button. Using the regular charger, the phone takes nearly 2 hours to fully charge but charge lasts for more than 1 day for my regular usage. Phone is slippery - so I have added a Spigen case as well. On the whole a good iphone.",2621308996,18537
"Amazing product, fell in love with IPhone.In short I can tell this product is dam equal to premium 48-64 mega pixel camera phones in market,even bit more.I got it for all time low price 38000/-",2621301682,18537
"Flawless product, really good product thanks Amazon received the perfect without any default or any. Mobile performance is awesome as I have upgraded from iPhone 6s to Xr feeling great and enjoying the new features face unlock and others. Face unlocking is very fast and quick compare to other android phone 5 ⭐️ from my side👍👍👌",2621278782,18537
The product was intact. Great packaging. The phone feels amazing. It’s my first time using an iPhone and I really think the XR is worth it if you want an iPhone that doesn’t burn a deep hole in your pocket.,2621261318,18537
It’s my first iPhone and I am totally happy with it. One thing that iPhone XR is having a best battery backup. And I love the performance. I was having a Redmi Note 4 device previously. It was having a 4 GB ram but it’s performance was not up to the mark. I am surprised how iPhone is handling this kind of performance in only 3 GB of RAM 🤔,2621249005,18537
Not happy with battery life. Rest everything Is fine.,2621149966,18537
Just loving the XR and is super value for money. Camera quality is really good and screen size is just perfect for watching videos and doesn’t look bulky at all. Only downside is that the Apple logo at the back on the black colour isn’t visible to the naked eye so prominently. Best iPhone after the 6s model.,2621093710,18537
"Not bulky, not big, this is a perfect sized iPhone. Display is crisp and clear. Smart hdr photos are great. It was a steal deal for me at Rs. 37999 during special sale. Delivered within 22 hours of ordering.",2621083748,18537
"Got it for ₹37,999 and at this price it is the best phone. Though a little bulky and heavy but it’s fine.",2620926962,18537
"Camera quality, battery life both are best features of the phone. No fingerprint sensors are drawbacks. Little bit heavy than OnePlus 5T. Never used LCD screen feeling odd for a while but it's worth for money. Built is very strong. iPhone comes with some unnecessary apps I will delete it later.",2620873239,18537
Excellent camera and phone build. There is no finger print reader in this but Face ID is ur answer for all this. Works great and secure. Battery is super better when compared to older iPhones and lasts more then 24 hrs with calls music Bluetooth devices connected and browsing and social media. Pretty satisfied so far.,2620855849,18537
"Overall Iphone XR is far better than X and other predecessors. Processor is way fast than others, build quality is awesome ,face recognition is too quick and the feel which you get by holding it is superlike. One suggestion to Apple that they must include fingerprint sensors too for more effective security.",2620841744,18537
Bought it for 49999 on sale and it's totally worth it. I'm using iPhone for 1st time and totally in love with it. As iPhone is famous for its camera quality and it's true. Only problem is that it doesn't have the fingerprint lock.,2620819047,18537
I’ve been using this phone since a week now and i must say its totally worth the money! Just go for it!,2620708702,18537
"Device was heating too much after just a little bit of graphic works on that. Camera was too bad , front camera is no where matching the quality of IOS. I was totally disappointed with that device , I think they sold me the defective peice in the name of sale on your platform. This kind of professionalism is not good . I believe too much on Amazon but later on that I am not giving any bulk amount of order on this e commerce platform. Sorry for the comments if it hurts anyone.",2620668457,18537
I bought 2 iPhone XR both are awesome. Can’t really say much the phone itself makes a statement.,2620667852,18537
"I just loved it and I think the only thing that is lagging in this product which is the oled screen is not an issue at all , the quality of the lcd is way too good and as long as you are not too obsessed with every feature to be the latest and best , go for it , plus now they are offering at a way better price , definitely worth it",2620636821,18537
"Camera quality is good. 4/5 stars. Rear camera at night is awesome. It gives the effect of DSLR. Front camera is of average quality, grains when taken photo. But apple camera gives the natural effect to your photos!",2620609531,18537
It’s been about a month using the IPhone XR. Was too enthusiastic about buying this phone.,2620599564,18537
"Front camera deteriorating everyday. Front camera quality is supper flop, even worst den any minimum range android phone. Rear camera is also not at per. Face detector not so good. No finger print available hence facing problems most of the time. Overall Apple releases a bad number with this variant.",2620564958,18537
Got this for 38k and received within 2 day of placing order ....Apple FACE ID is the most secure way of unlocking your phone which you wouldn't get on an another phone...camera is also top notch and is the same camera which iphone XS has got  but without the 2nd  telephoto/wide angle lens....overall quite happy with the iphone xr.,2620542567,18537
I upgraded from my iPhone 7 to XR and I’m really happy with the performance looks and all the new features. Battery life is awesome and face recognition works perfectly even in dark. Total value for money and it goes without saying as it is an Apple product.,2620508553,18537
"I’m so happy to say, it’s an authentic/genuine Apple Product. Will definitely buy again. Amazon actually gives you better discounts than Resellers.",2620474505,18537
"Received it yesterday, transferring data from my 7 plus took a couple of hours( maybe because of net issues) but everything on my old phone came on this XR. The camera is truly amazing. Go for it.",2620454938,18537
"Excellent device.Value for money. I already have iPhone 11 . I bought this for my friend there is not a single difference when compared to iPhone 11. Phone display,performance,everything same as iPhone 11. I’m pretty much satisfied.",2620452691,18537
"Liked display, camera quality, response etc. battery life is not great compared to 5000 mih Android phone. 18 hours from full charge.",2620399302,18537
It’s price dropped to 39000+discounts within 20 days I purchased at 52000. It seemed to be cheated. A huge -ve impact for further purchases. Site as well as apple have to manage all things regarding it otherwise both will lose their credibility. No doubt product is good but these huge fluctuations in price ruined whole prospects of the product,2620278861,18537
Has every thing you might be looking in an iPhone except the oled screen camera is as good as iPhone Xs with few limitations. If display is not a big concern for you you can't get a better phone than this at this price range.,2620269117,18537
Amazing camera in bright light. Average to poor performance in medium and low light conditions. Great battery. Privacy protection is an understated advantage.,2620263378,18537
"The iPhone XR delivers fast performance, great cameras and longer battery life than other flagship phones, all in a colorful and affordable package.",2620259131,18537
"Everything is well checked and warranty looks legitimate. Absolutely genuine product without any doubt. Bought yellow colour, feels mango in my hand. Getting a worthy case is real challenge though.",2620249729,18537
"After Using IPhone 6s & OnePlus 6, IPhone XR 128gb is juz awesome in face recognition battery life & user interface, Compared to IPhone 11 lesser in cost  both are in same size & same 4G !",2620245030,18537
Such a good iphone for such a great price.,2620239889,18537
"Its just a phone with good features, if switching from android you will love using its interface, a pure secure platform and flawless running experience.",2620154039,18537
"Excellent product, 100% original! I bought iPhone XR 128gb in the month of October, I was double minded to buy this product as all know online products will never reach us perfectly. But my assumption failed with this product.",2620149268,18537
in one word I forgot android.. lovely phone,2620103151,18537
"This phone is a beast. Man,the phones touch response is just awesome and iOS is so buttery smooth.",2620087810,18537
" This is my first apple device in terms of phone. The phone is totally worth it (every penny).  The colour, camera, design, sound quality everything is just way beyond perfection.",2620080696,18537
Got It for 38k. Ditched One plus 7T for this and I am very happy with this decision and ya screen is great but you will feel difference if you are coming from 1440p display else it is great.,2620020798,18537
"Great phone camera is good ,battery is good , but it take too much time to charge , company #APPLE need to give fast charger in box. And one more thing the weight of iphone xr is little bit more than other android phone.  Other wise phone is great.......gaming performance is great😘",2620019350,18537
" Just want to say GO FOR IT! I got it for 39,999 in the Amazon Great Indian festival and let me tell you, it arrived within 24 hours. Even though iPhone 11 is here, it has the same exact screen and almost the same features except the camera. If you are a die hard camera fan, then go for iPhone 11. But this works for me :)",2620007200,18537
Don't buy iPhone on amazon,2619974932,18537
The phone which a person need this is one for them. Really loved it everything in this price range bybapple it is very good product. But i m not satisfied with its display. Display quality and clearity is very poor 720p video play is not good so blurry,2619956575,18537

Go for it guys.",2619939882,18537
Nothing to say about iPhone it’s always the best phone. But this time i have to thank Amazon for bringing the cost down and affordable during great indian sale which says IRRESISTIBLE DEAL which really is a irresistible deal,2619918010,18537
"iPhone XR is Good and I am yet to use all features of the phone, I had used iPhone 5, 6s. Lots new features available .",2619871285,18537
It’s a great phone. Cut some stars as the camera developed a problem after only 6 weeks. But Apple has fixed it. But it was unexpected and Apple and the seller must ensure that these things don’t happen,2619714854,18537
"The phone conks off, don’t think the OS can take load. Been just 2 months and it’s already acting up. Not sure if the problem is with the device or orders from amazon.",2619694590,18537
Display 4/5,2619683480,18537
I always thought to buy iPhone and every time I used to think that what is so special in iPhone but yes after buying iPhone XR I can say that no one can replace this. Starting from battery life to the screen which is standard and can be used one handed. Camera quality is also very good which you can realise after two three clicks only. So for me iPhone XR is a beast at low price among other iPhone models.,2619660233,18537
Camera not that great.,2619617477,18537

"I purchased this beauty in big billion sale. Thus I got it at a remarkable price. The battery life is good so far and the speed has been pretty good. I love the overall look, size and design of this model a lot. The camera quality is great but definitely the higher version have a better camera quality experience to provide.",2628750019,18538
"I am iphone lover but always disappointed with battery back up. But after getting this superb phone my love towards iphone become more stronger. Amazing camera screen clarity, good time response, face unlock takes leasser than eye blink.amazing battery back up. Stunning look. Overall no need to purchase dslr camera. Spend money on it and u get phone for the lifetime.",2628731526,18538
While so far all my iPhones before had a small write up about the licensing etc at the back of the phone. This XR does not have any writing.,2628725681,18538
"Phone is excellent...Thanks to Amazon for their service. But the delivery was pathetic, the delivery boy refused to deliver the product. I, myself went to their office to get my phone. Hope that it will not repeat in future.",2628722472,18538
The camera quality in night is awesome..there are lots of features to do edit the pictures and videos. Other than that battery life is around 1.5 days in normal usage and 6-8 hours in heavy games like pubg asphalt videos YouTube play music etc. at the price of 43k it’s a steal....,2628708106,18538
"Received my iPhone within a week after place the order, Had issues with it but thanks to amazon for speedy replacement.",2628676606,18538
"Using the XR for the past 3 months and I’m completely delighted to have this model. Certainly a value for money product in the iPhone flagship category. Battery life is excellent, charging for one time in a day itself will have enough power for the remaining day. Camera quality is comparatively better than the other high end categories iPhones.",2628657053,18538
"Camera is very good .Screen size is just right for people like me who use phone for typing mails to watching Netflix .One can download multiple apps .Speed is good .Face recognition works like magic .Have been using iPhone since last 5 yrs ,and have found no reason to complain so far.",2628656530,18538
"It's one of the best phones available in the market right now. Apple always gives the best products to its customers. It had A12 chipset which can do 5 trillion operations per second. It never slows down. It gives you the best phone using experience. Go for it, if you can buy it. Don't buy Samsung products or OnePlus products they are just useless. Just go for the product.",2628649657,18538

First of all I thank Amazon for such blazing fast delivery and the packaging was terrific. So trustworthy.

I have purchased this product during the diwali sale on Oct 22 and now the adaptor doesn't work. A product worth 43k having an adaptor life of 22 days... I don't even know what else to do now. Removed the sim and started using old broken phone since morning,2628365236,18538
I am using iPhone from last 8 years. This model no need to carry power bank(for me) compared with iPhone 6s and 7,2628357639,18538
"People who say iPhone XR has inferior display, please use before u judge based on specs. I’ve been using Pixel and recently switched to iPhone XR and I loved it. Battery life is unrivalled and Fave ID is charm.",2628336249,18538
"5 star quality... 1st apple product for my wife and in the family, Very good phone, clear crisp sound quality, Amazing display ... Apple doesn't compromise with it's product. Highly recommended.",2628314908,18538

"Not happy with the mobile , let me know if u guys can send new mobile or can give a option to upgrade to iphone 11 . Let me know what best can be done .",2628069673,18538
The first thing you notice about XR is it’s battery. Super long battery of more than 24 hours. Rest is exactly as it should be in an iPhone. Camera also needs a special mention. Great camera.,2627944246,18538
"Does what it is supposed to do. True iPhone, no exceptions.",2627838807,18538
Gud phone ...camera is super..,2627816987,18538

There is nothing much to say specially about iPhone. I have used several android devices and I switched to iPhone XR from OnePlus 6. Simply this switching is fabulous experience to me.,2627791339,18538
"Got it for 39000 in the great Indian sale along with exchange (redmi 4) and using SBI credit card. Anawesome phone. Once we use iPhone, android phones seem cheap. You start appreciating little details that Apple has done to make this phone worth its price and hype. If you can afford, then close your eyes and bye it. You will not be disappointed",2627784324,18538

"Awesome phone, great battery life it can last upto 2 whole days, face ID works great even if you are in dark room. Screen size perfect so that we can do tasks using single hand. Will get long term support. 5w charging adapter works well but it's good to have 12w charger than 5w.",2627461003,18538

There is no doubt about the picture quality when it comes to iphone.",2626810161,18538
I am big Apple fan from almost decade 😃and they have never disappointed either on the hardware side or the iOS( operating system). Got this from amazon deal at very attractive price,2626791996,18538
It is really a good one by apple. Easy to use and very fast processor. I just love it... and big advantage is it supports dual sim but now the price has been dropped to 54990 by apple in india,2626710823,18538
Ya really super phone/they’re confusing to(AirPods &Earpods) this phone with EarPods with lightening connector only not for Bluetooth AirPod ur clearly understand then u will pay,2626450839,18538

No lesser than iPhone XS Max,2626151362,18538

"It's a very pretty and good looking mobile. Performance wise, it is super smooth. Camera is as good as iPhone XS, portrait mode is also good enough.  And the best part is, being an iphone it has a long lasting battery. Though it has LCD, but you would hardly be able to find any difference between this and OLED. Size is perfect, infact everything is perfect and cool!",2625861617,18538

Best price-quality MacBook in the history of Apple.,2639741783,18539
"This is a very good computer. Very fast and works with most people.... but, some apps just don't work. They used to work in my other Macbook pro. but on this M1 it simple won't work.... apps like Google drive!!!! for good sake!Even worst... trying to return... 15% restocking fee.Serious Amazon?!",2639709414,18539
Never owned a Mac and now never going back to Windows.  So smooth and fast with phenomenal battery life up to 8+ hours. Great screen as well with backlit keyboard. Easy to transfer files from Windows.  This is money well spent replacing a 5+ years old slow heavy HP laptop!,2647119592,18540
"I love, love, love this computer. I just love the fact of having everything in the cloud. When I try to look at some file that I was working on my MacBook from my phone, it will come up quickly and fast. Everything is synced. Love the keyboard, the features, the color and texture of it, will definitely stay with Apple!",2646971795,18540
"Amazed that it uploaded all my files and I for from cloud. Just turned it on and it worked, syncing with phones and iPad 👏👏👏👏",2646822820,18540
"Upon receiving my new Mac, which I waited days for, I questioned the condition of the box.  Apple has very nice packaging but this looked beat up and worn.  I did need to call technical support for something and found out by providing the serial number that my “new” Mac Air was already out of the 90 day warranty.  I received a used computer.  With the price I paid, this kinda makes my blood boil. This one is going back and i WILL get a new one in return.",2646821305,18540
"I am not a computer nerd, I use my computer to finish charts from work when I am at home or to just browse the web so the MacBook Air was all I needed. I love the screen, the keyboard, size, and weight.",2646796211,18540
"Needless to say, I love my Macbook Air. This is the first time I purchased a laptop that's apple. I have owned one in the past, but it felt good actually purchasing my own this time. Now I not only have an Ipad, Apple Watch, Apple phone but I now have an Apple Macbook Air.",2646684595,18540
I ordered the Macbook to use for my model railroad.  I now use it as my portable computer.  it is small and powerful........,2646662598,18540
"Did not like the color. The gold is NOT gold, rather rose gold. So this is a misrepresentation on the color. If you think it will be true gold color, you will be disappointed. It looks and is rose gold has a pink color to the gold.",2646631770,18540
Super duper awesome,2646606970,18540
"The connections are really lacking on this laptop, but everything else is consistent with what you'd hope from an Apple product. Over priced, but good quality and decent support. Buy the additional warranty or Apple care.",2646575754,18540
I am extremely happy with this purchase! The screen quality is amazing and it seems like I never need to recharge it. I got a great deal on it and the genius at the Apple store told me it was a great model so that did it for me!,2646567065,18540
Love it,2646540783,18540

"The item is great, allows me to be productive without worrying about performance being an issue. It was shipped quickly and arrived at my front door just 5 days after purchasing. Highly recommend this laptop for those who don’t need the highest specs but, can get by doing mostly everything you throw at it just fine.",2646473206,18540
"You get what you pay for, and that $1000 I dropped on this MacBook was worth. I went through a few cheap laptops that went from $200-400 bc I needed it for my college classes and then after wasting my time buying and returning them,  I finally decided to go all out and no regrets with this purchase. 10/10",2646470208,18540
"Almost everything is top-notch: Performance, battery life, new magic keyboard, usual unparalleled trackpad, quality of materials and build. I was a little concerned about lower screen brightness of MB Air versus MB Pro prior to purchase, but have no complaints. Only feature less than excellent is camera, which is only 720p. Limited ports only a minor inconvenience. Most highly recommended.",2646463156,18540
Amazing system but run into issue so had to return the product.,2646452558,18540
I recommend others to buy it and It's perfect for school,2646437625,18540
I absolutely love this MacBook!! It has a finger print scan to unlock it and to fill in passwords which is so handy. The battery life lasts for a long time. The screen quality is flawless. It’s super fast and comes with so many useful apps on it!,2646431346,18540
Work and play,2646431262,18540
"The M1 chip is amazing and a miracle, this little chip can play some of the most cpu demand games around cities skylines it played phenomenal without any lag or freezing. This MacBook Air is very powerful. the downside to it, is that it doesn't have a cooling fan and one cooling fan in it would make a major improvement.",2646394347,18540
"El rendimiento del equipo es genial, la duración de la batería es asombrosa, cumple con todas funciones descritas, lastima que solo tiene 2 puertos tipo C, pero con la compra de un Hub se soluciona el problema. En resumen una muy buena adquisición de mi parte.",2646349605,18540
"This computer is a good buy and works very well. My only complaint is that I have been a pc user all of my life (more than 60 years) and I am having some challenges with the OS. Not their fault. Delivery, packaging, speed, and everything seems really good. I am satisfied.",2646347932,18540
this is a great laptop for everyday use. love the build quality. the screen and speakers are amazing. I love how fast this laptop is. the thin and light weight of it is amazing.,2646171987,18540
"Best investment I could have made for my business! I’m still adjusting to Apple computers, as I’m transitioning out technology from Windows. But this computer has cut my time for work, and photography projects, down so much! Tasks that used to take me 3 hours, only take 1 now.🤨🙌🏾",2646102046,18540
Blazing fast!  This was my first Mac and I was Only familiar with iOS devices so I can compare to past models. But I can say that the MacBooks with the M1 chips our as fast as an iPad when it comes to light duty things.,2645998797,18540
Absolutely wonderful and showed up charged and. ready to go. Make sure you migrate everything from your older Mac or have a solid time machine backup to transfer. Only downfall is it has no USB ports. Buy your year’s version of a Macbook Air to USB port and/or HDMI adapter at a minimum.,2645951910,18540
Get this computer for all intents and purposes! I bought it for IT and database administration and I just wanted a computer who could think for me. This is it. Along with its long computer time and screen life,2645870955,18540
There's nothing to dislike the laptop comes with own software ready to turned it on and start using it,2645829041,18540
This has been the best purchase I have made in a very long time. My computer can go days without needed a recharge and has a sheik finish. I have shared this link with many already. The greatest of all is that it last for years!,2645821027,18540
"Currently writing this review on the laptop Everything about it is amazing. This could be the best laptop ever made by apple as the m1 chip is mind-blowingly fast. Keyboard and touchpad feel are amazing. Convenience is unmatched with all of the built in features that work seamlessly. For students, there's no better option for this great of a value.",2645759070,18540
This is a replacement for my 11 year old MacBook Pro that still works but I’m glad to have this new MacBook Pro Air. It’s battery life is far better that my old one and I am enjoying its much lighter weight. Amazon’s price was the best I could find and with my Prime Chase card I am buying it interest free.,2645745656,18540
"This laptop is great. It's fast, slim and battery life is pretty awesome. The camera isn't the best and I don't love Apple's new keyboards, they have very little travel. Besides that I'm very pleased with my purchase.",2645638656,18540
"This review is for a brand new Apple MacBook Air with Apple’s M1 processor. I got it here on Amazon for $200 less than what they sell for on Apple’s website. I bought it to replace my 10 year old MacBook Pro that has performed flawlessly. Unfortunately this new MacBook Air was defective from the start. It would crash frequently with this weird pink screen of death. It would come back up with a MacOS kernel panic log.  I would also get the spinning beach ball. And it would randomly reboot itself, even when I wasn’t using it. We can only speculate on why this MacBook Air was such a good deal. Returning it for a refund was not easy and required a phone call to Amazon then a scheduled pickup from my home with an adult.",2645616006,18540
"My old MacBook Air lasted 8 years and died a peaceful death. Even so, Apple gave me $130 credit for it. It’s so wonderful to have a new one!",2645586027,18540
Honestly all I know is that my daughter loves it and thats all that matters to me!,2645578357,18540
"This item was very horrible! The touch screen never worked , it was overpriced and it was defected and AMAZON ONLY TOLD ME I WOULD GET 80% of what I paid for this product back ! That’s bs . They are keeping almost $300 of what I paid for a defective product  I returned my computer for refund for defects. I have been disrespected, condescended, lied to by customer service over and over again over this return. They say calls are recorded for customer service satisfaction. They lie. After being guaranteed by a supervisor that I would receive my complete amount of purchase refund , and waived as a one time courtesy the restocking fee, I would have no problem with this ; all I would have to do is call back after they initiated the first part of the refund when they received the computer back—- and on another call to see what was the status because it had been the time for them to have received the computer back already, another customer service assured me that it was noted again he saw as a one time courtesy I would receive the waived restocking fee, I would just need to wait again until Monday . This didn’t happen, they were rude, condescending and denied it was noted and hung up on me.",2645567702,18540
I have been a Mac user for a long time and this one is certainly up to standards. Got some great help from Mac setting it up and ended the frustrations of my old one.,2645562011,18540
Llego en excelente estado,2645539567,18540
I love it. This is my first IOS computer and I’m in love. The quality put into it is top notch. This is my primary computer for school and everyday use. It’s well worth the investment!!,2645529764,18540
First MacBook and I am in love! I have been using my computer for two days and still have 60% battery life. Very impressive because I have been using it a lot. I’m still getting use to the different feel on how to use it but it really is self explanatory once you start using it.,2645508890,18540
"Nowhere was it mentioned that this is the castrated 7 GPU Core version. Feeling deceived. In addition, the 8 GB RAM / 256GB SSD Version is nigh useless for anything beyond websurfing. Having multiple apps open concurrently almost immediately yields the spinning beach ball of death. With a regular set of apps, like the MS Office suite, the disk fills up in no time. Now OS updates are not working, since they require at least 15 GB disk space. But - battery life is out of this world, with the CPU temp sitting at 36C!",2645508427,18540
"I've chewed through 2 MacBook Pros in the last 12 years but this MacBook Air is the best out-of-the-box laptop yet. The keyboard is amazing. The track pad is indescribably good--they've always been good but...damn. The Activity Monitor is back and it's a icon on the dock. Yay!Also, Amazon knocked it out of the park. I ordered free shipping on Friday and received on Monday morning before I left for work. Everything was well packaged. 5 stars for Amazon on this one. It's nice to be able to say something nice about them for a change. :)Damn. I forgot to add that Apple is a corporation that fluffs totalitarian dictatorships and actively engages in slave labor and censorship. All is good in lefty bubble world, right?",2645506633,18540
Powerful laptop that can handle music production and djing softwares without problems. This computer is so light and thin that it is unbelievable how well it works.There is no need to buy a Macbook Pro M1. Shop this one without hesitation.,2645499390,18540
"Everything is so snappy.Great screen, amazing battery life.Windows users, do not hesitate on getting this. After more than 10 years using windows and in certain years of college Mac OS, this runs like a f1 car.Trust me, if you want to buy a new laptop, this is it.",2645497509,18540
Best laptop i’ve ever owned 🫶🏼,2645488489,18540
Personal use - replaces my previous MacBook Air.Great improvements to a classic.,2645465525,18540
"Love my new Mac !  It’s very light, battery lasts a long time. Days even - with light use.  Charges quickly too.  I haven’t bought a case yet - it’s too gorgeous to cover up!  But will buy a sleeve for transporting when I travel. No complaints.  LOVE IT.",2645456787,18540
The solid state drive makes this laptop a speed demon!  Ultra rite screen. The laptop hardly weighs anything at all. Charges really fast. Holds charge a long time. Great keyboard and easy bluetooth connection to my trackball. Really nothing to complain about.,2645422317,18540
"Llego hasta las puertas de mi caso en un estado excelente como si lo hubiera comprado en una tienda, vino sellada, es parecida es l software y su arreglo a las otras Mac igual de organizadas, trabaja bastante rápido, pero hay que reconocer que la calidad de la cámara es menor que las generaciones anteriores.",2645372602,18540
The MacBookAir does not have a touch screen and I don't use it for gaming. It is a great notebook just as it is.,2645337266,18540
"First venture into Mac. Laptop has some heft to it with a nice aluminum chassis. Screen is sharp, very bright and responsive. Keyboard is on par with other laptops I use daily (Lenovo). Blows standard laptops out of the water with battery life.",2645311723,18540
"My first Apple product. Great hardware and software. Coming from Windows Lifer, it had been no problem getting upto speed on Big Sur. Got it on promotion too for 850. No brainer.Best laptop purchase I ever made.",2645280112,18540
Llegó en algo menos de dos días. Está Macbook air M1 es lo mejor de lo mejor. La capacidad de memoria es asombrosa. La rapidez parece indicar que Apple se ha adelantado muchos años.,2645279617,18540
Computer is lightweight and fast but... right out of the box I had a service battery notice. Charged it up and it was still there. Made an appointment with the nearest Apple store (20 miles away). They confirmed my Mac was made this month so it was brand new but they can’t replace it since it was bought from Amazon and not Apple. They sent it out for a new battery under warranty which was to take 3-5 days and they have had it a week now and haven’t completed the repair yet. All around not a good experience for my first Mac and spending a thousand bucks on a laptop. I’ll be going back to pc after this.,2645153075,18540
"This computer lived up to and surpassed my highest expectations. I could not recommend it more. The battery life is surreal. The screen is gorgeous. It is snappy, fast, and outperforms my much more expensive previous gen Macs. Such an incredible feat of engineering.",2645152396,18540
"Attractive gold colour that looks like rose gold, lightweight, speedy. Ideal for browsing the internet, reading emails, Microsoft Office. Purchased brand new from the Apple Store on Amazon - ""Ship and Sold by Amazon"". Received in pristine condition with one year Apple Warranty.",2645109929,18540
Got it for my daughter for school. I asked her after she spent some time with it- how is it? Her response was- I LIKE IT!!! That answers all my questions! That's all I want to know. Apple 🍎👌,2645109461,18540
"YOU WILL NEVER REGRET THIS PURCHASE IF YOU ARE A MAC PERSON.  IT IS GOOD FOR PC PERSONS AS LONG AS THEY ARE WILLING TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT, AS IT IS DIFFERENT FROM A PC.  SOME SOFTWARE IS MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND.",2645075521,18540
"I have to reset this thing at least 5 times per week in the middle of meetings and such for no reason. I've done all the updates and it's brand new, it just doesn't work. I'm guessing this has to do with the fact that it has an Apple chip instead of an Intel one, and like most things Apple actually makes its glitchy and unreliable. Makes sense that it was on sale. If you have to buy an Apple try to get the ones that have the fewest Apple parts as possible.",2645029195,18540
Completely closed and never used. Excellent but excellent laptop. Great investment,2645017056,18540
I was skeptical at first but now I’m convinced!  ARM Is like the cpu in the terminator movies! lol. No fan and battery last all day easily!  It absolutely crushes my 6 core i7 MacBook Pro on Geekbench test!  You will not regret buying one!  Look at the picture and see for yourself!,2644925210,18540
It was time to update a pc laptop and and took the plunge and switch to an apple product. It's a great system and works well with my other apple products ie iPhone/AirPods. I especially like the fingerprint function. Nothing to complain about for this user.,2644899202,18540
"I had a MacBook Pro that is over ten years old and has served me well, but it was time to upgrade. Happy so far, the light weight is awesome, keyboard is excellent and quiet, so far so good!",2644866494,18540
"Wonderrful upgrade, easy to migrate and Amazon delivered as promised.",2644766153,18540
"I purchased a MacBook Air (Late 2020) from Amazon on September 17th.  After a week of use, the screen has lines on it.  Before the 30-day return window was up, I brought it to the apple store (twice).  The Apple Store, would not replace the unit and the staff would not send the unit out to be fixed at no cost. The store claimed “damage” was done to the laptop.  An unacceptable response where the laptop was used over a week with normal use, on a desk. This is a defect, not “damage”.  Additionally, employee at the Apple Store, said that he could only “swap it out” if we purchased it from Apple directly.  This is unacceptable, I purchased this unit from Amazon which is an authorized Apple Retailer.  The same policies need to be applied, or why bother having authorized retailers.The screens on the M1 MacBook Airs are fragile and are of poor quality.  Apple won’t stand behind its product and fix it. Amazon will take back the laptop and I’m getting a full refund.  Apple needs to address the screen issue on their laptops, improve their warranty and retrain staff.  The M1 MacBook Air has poor components, poor warranty and the Apple staff are not handling these issues well.  Apple is blaming customers for Apple’s poor build quality.",2644718652,18540
"I've needed a new laptop for years and finally decided to buy one, but had not planned on purchasing a MacBook.  After reviewing many options I clearly made the right choice.  I love it!!!DW",2644656190,18540
"Great laptop, feels so premium. Fast enough for common use and the battery mas a lot, I have to charge it every three or four days.",2644630028,18540
Was bought as a graduation gift for my daughter. Display quality and sound from the built in speakers is exceptional. She currently  only uses it for Netflix and YouTube until college starts in a few weeks though lol.,2644603247,18540
No need to say anything,2644533547,18540
This thin laptop is attractive and works efficiently.  Great graphics.,2644433362,18540
"I love my Mac book Air.  Very easy to use.  I love that everything goes to iPhone, iPad and Mac book and I don't have to do anything.  I have not began to use all of the 100's of features.  Extremely pleased.",2644184556,18540
Beautiful and looks really nice.  Quality looks like true Apple quality.  Battery life is respectable.  No touch screen but keyboard makes it easy to use,2644157673,18540
I LOVE this laptop.  The new Apple M1 processor is lightning fast and the graphics are out of this world.  I also love the top of the line wifi card. All for just over $1K,2644146028,18540
"Love this lap top but it’s ridiculous that it doesn’t have an usb or hdmi, so if you plan to buy MacBooks then get the adapter too. Otherwise you won’t be able to connect your phone to your laptop.",2644142141,18540
"I’ve had the same MacBook Pro for 7 years and it was finally time to get a new one. I wasn’t sure about the Air, but I’m so happy I went with it! Not a bad price, shipped very quickly, battery lasts a long time, I just love it.",2644127523,18540
Great value and device my youngest daughter loves it.,2643969488,18540
M1 processor performs great.  Would rate a 5 if I could run my iPad applications.  Limited apps compared to iPhone and iPad.  Hopefully this will improve.,2643962272,18540
"So I have never bought any Apple laptops off Amazon but it did arrive wrapped and packaged as if it came from Apple itself. Battery life is great, keyboard is great and it’s light. I don’t use laptop cameras so I can’t say either way on how good it is or isn’t.",2643858151,18540
"This MacBook was the best purchase I made this year. Highly recommend! The battery lasts for days,  the magical keyboard is so helpful writing at night.

"Upgraded from my 2014 MacbookAir b/c it was slowing down. This 2020 MacbookAir started out great, but within 3 weeks it's slowing down too! Display is more or less fine. Front camera quality seems to have deteriorated somewhat. But trying to open applications, download/upload files, etc . . . is getting slow now and it's annoying.",2643749935,18540

"Aun no cumple un año, la camara esta pixelada, un día de repente se estropeó el display y recien se me acaba de salir una tecla y no me funciona. No se golpeo ni nada, de la nada.Yo tenia una mac del 2012 q funcionaba perfecto, solo la cambie porque se me cayo jugo encima, pero sino era por ese accidente seguia años. Era fan de mac, y ahora estoy muy muy desilusionada, hacen todo para q no dure nada y lo tenga q cambiar. No la recomiendo mas! Yo contacte a soporte y ni bola me dieron, queria extender la garantia y no se puede porque claramente saben q falla. No compro mas una mac, lamentablemente tendre que mudar de marca porque yo pagaba con gusto por un producto de excelencia q duraba años, pero que se rompa tanto en menos de un año ... Q pena que hayan bajado la calidad de esta manera.",2643618360,18540
Top quality computer,2643467873,18540
I only have one thing I didn’t like.... it actually has nothing to do with the computer!I LOVE the computer but when the delivery guy destroyed our yard because they drove through it and got stuck is really aggravating! This is NOt the first time they have done this! And we have asked multiple times NOT to do it! We have multiple areas where Amazon workers have drove in our yard and messed it up!  They tell us that they will fix it but never do! My mother in law  and father in law are pissed so be prepared for a call from them :-),2643443304,18540

Only 8 gigs of ram and 256 of storage. Lack of ports too.",2649766462,18540

"I had given this a few months since release for some of the software compatibility issues to be straightened out, and was encouraged by reviews. However, there are significant unresolved issues from the hardware side of things: 1. there is a known problem with disk usage related to RAM disk swap (from what I understand) and media-heavy usage (why I bought this laptop) deteriorates the SSD quickly. 2. the FaceTime camera is absolutely terrible. There is no other way to put this. It may be the worst camera I have seen on any device since my iPhone 3G. The picture is incredibly blurry, and not suitable for the COVID/virtual environment. There have been issued raised about this in Apple support forums with no resolution.Unfortunately my return window has passed, but I would not recommend this machine to anyone. Really thought Apple had turned a corner with their new processor, but ended up being stuck with a bunch of other systems that weren't upgraded. 2/10",2648598669,18540

New M1 chip is fast! great performance for normal everyday tasks... overpriced as usual.,2647406167,18540

The MacBook Air has a beautiful screen but no touchscreen support. It also has an excellent trackpad.

If you aren’t familiar with MacBooks, it takes some adjusting to go from a laptop to a MacBook. I ended up returning the MacBook and purchased a laptop instead.",2650331806,18541

Laptop worked for a couple of days and then promptly failed. Battery completely died (stopped holding charge) and power supply also failed! I had to go to an Apple store to power it back up and wipe it out to return it. Worst thing about this experience is the return policy; my only option is UPS pickup. I have been staying home all day for 4 days but UPS has not shown up. Amazon support is also a joke.,2648994913,18540

"Looked forward to this new MacBook Air.  Loved the Magic Keyboard, but everything else seems half-baked Apple.I didn't know enough to immerse myself in the (hard-to-find)  Essentials Manual before touching the FORCE touchpad.  Took a long time that to realize that ""force""  really meant FORCE (as in ""smash it down"" )  There is a System Preferences bypass, but I got embroiled in a DARK MODE display (black screen), missing cursor, and of course loss of Intel-chip based favorite apps which all took precedence over trying to find and read a possible Manual.  Help menu did not help..I tried, I really did.  Apple Support suggested and helped for 2 days, with hours spent trying over & over to erase, then Reinstall Big Sur  software, but 2 hours loading (for each of dozens of tries), then ""An error occurred preparing this update.  Please try again.""was too much, over and over.  This software is not ready for primetime.  Looking forward to AIR's next iteration.Meanwhile, I must be content with my older MacBook Pro, while MacBoo Air is returned:  ""rest in peace"".",2653013967,18541

"UPDATE: the battery is not dead - the motherboard is.The computer worked fine for 14 months and then the battery died. Wouldn't charge, wouldn't hold a charge while plugged in. I took it to the Apple store where they told me it would be $428 to fix the problem (I bought a replacement Microsoft laptop for less than that). They wanted me to complain to Amazon for selling me a dud when I was talking to them about fixing it. Bad customer service, don't stand behind their product, and I won't be buying a Mac again as it just turned out to be a $1000 paperweight.",2697645777,18545
"I was so excited to buy my first MacBook.  Opened the first one and nothing zip, zero, dead. Charged it, called Apple, who told me to return it.  It took over an hour to get Amazon to accept the return and ship me a replacement.  Next morning get MacBook number 2- super excited because I open it and it comes on and sings a song! Loved it for the 3 hours it worked.  It updated and Locked me out.  Did everything they told me to do online, call Apple that admits they are having this issue and I can return it for another one! Since it’s not 14 days old.  No thanks.  I am done.  Since Apple told me to return it this time Amazon was amazing and is picking it up for return tomorrow.  This was a crappy experience.  I love my iPad Pro and iPhones- no more MacBook for me.",2697645082,18545

I opened it started it up and one I realized I had to buy accessories to add anything additional, I cleaned it and packed back up to return.

Nothing wrong with the MacBook itself. It was just not practical for me what I needed for my work. So I started a return. First you send them the product I guess in good faith. Then once they receive the item then with in 7 days they will refund your purchase. Mind you I returned this in the complete original package only 4 days after receiving it.

"I bought my computer in Feb 2021. Now it is April 2022 and it shuts itself off without warning, with a defective pink screen. I'd be surprised if it lasts throughout the month. I'm not sure if this is due to planned obsolescence, or some other reason. Either way, I am not impressed. One year is not a good shelf life for a computer. My previous MacBook lasted only 2 years before it shut itself down for good. My older MacBook Pro from 2012 still works, so I know that it is not me that is the problem.",2697511885,18545

I picked it up by the screen, and im a pretty tiny person.. and it like broke on the inside or something, the screen just shot out.. i wanted to just replace it for a new one But i would have had to go to the bank to put money in, because i guess you need the amount it would cost to do that. I was told that we would just do the refund, and i could rebuy it.. my refund seems to be taking a while, and it looks like the prices just went up on top of it. So im not very happy right now. i want to get the replacement. Def going to get the apple care plan (which also looks like it went up in price)  from like 2 days ago",2697508374,18545

Couldn’t use my usb had to buy a connector. Doesn’t connect to my canon printer - not compatible. Amazon sold me a windows office package for it was supposed to work. Not compatible. Bought a care package for support and problems. -no number to call. Not worth the money.,2697479931,18545

"I had my mac for one day before it quit working—it was installed with Big Sur, which has a bug in it causing the trackpad to malfunction. No trackpad = no way of using your laptop (especially because it won’t recognize an external mouse with this bug. I paid over a thousand dollars to have a computer for a single day. While it worked, the speed was great and the screen crystal clear, but both of those are pointless without a way to use the computer. I’m doing the 3-hour software update now to (hopefully) fix the problem, but I highly recommend purchasing a different computer.",2697470688,18545

"Bought 2 ipads, could not connect to internet, wasted money.  Bought an expensive phone, needed assembly, never worked, wasted money.  Bought a new MacBook, in setup after argument to use English, when I entered the Wi-Fi password 3 times, it never accepted it, it went nuts and sailed off into disability screens I could not fathom.  The touchpad seems not to work.  Does not have a USB port, without using an external mouse is less than junk to me.

"Don’t appreciate how I received a used macbook with fingerprints on the screen. They tried to put the film back on the screen as it was originally, but it wasn’t stuck to the screen as it should have been. I returned it because i refuse to spend that much money on something someone else had their hands one. It’s unacceptable especially due to covid. I went and bought one locally and it was brand new no fingerprints and the film was stuck to the screen as it should be because thats how Apple packages it.",2697459720,18545
"This machine is NOT powerful enough to run design software and Google Chrome at the same time. Just FYI. It's laggy, sputters, and a total piece of junk for the most part if you're trying to run any of Adobe Suite or Sketchup or heavy'ish program. It has trouble runing Keynote, Spotify, and chrome at the same time. This is great for surfing the web and using a few of the internal apple products but a complete waste of money if you're looking for a work computer and do any kind of creative design or work. Apple's products are garbage and we're all stuck in their hellish ecosphere.",2697456857,18545

Waiting for credit from Amazon on return via UPS. We were unable to have this laptop work with Zoom no audio or video and it was unstable with the Google Chrome browser. My son is a software engineer for a San Francisco Social media company and he thinks that this new processing chip being used by Apple is problematic.,2697453680,18545

"Shockingly substandard quality. It's very, very slow to respond. For THAT reason alone, it's getting returned, not because the box it came in smells musty like it's been sitting in a wet basement for years.",2697452398,18545

Impossible to use the camera. Had to purchase and external camera.,2697448005,18545
Back in 2020 I put the laptop on once. Tried to set it up and then shut it off since I couldn’t do it. Tried to turn it back it on in 2022 and it would not charge. Bought a battery from Apple and it still won’t turn in ! Such a waste of money for something I can’t even use.,2697447176,18545
I purchased the MacBook Air assuming the computer was new because the item said “new”.  After a week of owning the computer and charging once. I decided to look at the battery cycle count and it read “14”.  Meaning it had been charged 14 times at full cycle.  I contacted Apple and they said testing involves 1-3 cycles.  I suspect it was already used heavily for a month.  So I returned it.  Very hesitant to purchase a laptop again from Amazon.,2697446980,18545
Got this laptop for work and less than a year later I've had to service it twice. TRASH!!!!,2697444952,18545

Their support staff created more problems than I could ever have and i have wasted at least 20 hours on hold and trying to get Apple to set up my new MAC and I still cannot use this computer.  I am seriously thinking to send back and hoping I can!,2697444115,18545
I assumed it would operate like my I pad.  Takes forever for screen to respond when I click on something. It is not user friendly.  Waste of my money.  I wish I had returned it,2697441472,18545
I spent more than six hours on the phone with Apple support trying to get this to work. Total fail and waste of time. I never thought I’d buy an apple product that was defective.,2697441307,18545

I HAD a macbookpro from 2013 that was almost neck on photoshop and illustrator being almost 10 years old ! like cumoon ! … oh and u have to buy a dam dongle because it only comes with 2 usbc connections and u know dam welll one is for charging ! … also if u dont have another mac dont eveer open disk utility because u need a secoond one if u erase ur hardrive,2697441274,18545

Loving it so far. Wish I could afford a bigger screen but nice to be able to finally afford a new Mac after 13 years. I still find Microsoft office tools easier to use esp snipping tool I’m finding Macs version of this frustrating and confusing and not as simple but it’s still a Mac so whatever,2697438212,18545

"This would have been great, the computer is epic.  But why do you default to gold?  I bought this under a timeline to bring overseas and they sent me a gold version, like who wants that?

Rant over.",2697437156,18545
"The unit is smaller than the original Air, also it has NO USB ports, the description on the page is misleading and they never show the right-hand side of the unit in the pictures, otherwise, I would have never bought it, Amazon return policy is horrible they take 2 weeks to refund your money, took it out looked at it said nope, didn't even registered it.

This is my first MacBook and it's perfect entry laptop into the Apple brand.  I don't need it for a ton of applications so the MacBook Air is perfect for me.  I'm able to access all of my needed applications.  Easy transition from traditional laptop.  It is a little different with shortcuts from what I was use to but I've adapted quickly.  This laptop is lightweight and easy to use!,2697415613,18545
"So I am by no means a super heavy tech guy, but I was wanting a new laptop for when I go back to school, movie streaming, etc and I can say with confidence that this is the best laptop I have ever used, owned, typed on, you name it. I love how small, compact and portable the laptop is while still being able to pack the punch it is advertised to bring. I love the feel of the keyboard and feel like I am able to type lightning fast on it. I really have nothing bad to say about this laptop. Unless you are a heavy computer gamer I think this laptop is perfect for everybody. Make sure you look around because I was actually able to get this laptop from BestBuy for $799.99 brand new so I was able to get this laptop for a great price! Amazon at the time had it for the same price but I did not want to risk damage from shipping.",2697415135,18545

"I use my MacBook Air M1 equally docked and undocked. At home I can connect to up to three monitors with the help of a powered docking station and Display Link. When I purchased this one that I've had for about a year or so I was also issued an upgrade for my work Mac, a Pro that was also an M1 and fully loaded. The pro was thicker and a fair amount heavier so hauling both sucked sometimes.I'm sure some heavy dev's, gamers or power photoshop users that need a remote workstation away from their Mac Pro (or Mac Studio) a MacBook Pro may be a better options but that comes with the negative of a bigger form factor, bigger and heavier power adapter and a bit more cost.I think this is a great fit for knowledge workers, it blows my new Lenovo Win laptop for work out of the water) and still handles large card imports from my SLR and Mirrorless cameras like a champ. I'm really not seeing unacceptable delays in Light Room and only use PhotoShop on targeted issues rarely.This and a pair of Mac Pro noise canceling headphones were the two best Apple products I've bought in the last year and a half or so.",2697413854,18545
I don’t like this very much I Kant get the app that I need and like,2697413676,18545
"I think this laptop is overrated. Reviews say it does not get hot but with only 10 minutes of playing some games, it went super hot that i had to turn it off. The M1 processor which they say is powerful did not live up to all the hype. No wonder it's cheaper than dell xps 13.",2697413020,18545

"What's not to like. I bought the M1 Macbook Air just in case Apple decided to discontinue it even though my old Mackbook Pros (2012 and 2015) continue to work just fine.

"Ive had this since one since it came out and the screen just magically broke yesterday, do better apple. My dell has lasted almost 5 years now",2697405269,18545
"The MacBook Air is convenient like every other computer used daily and is compactible due to size. It goes for the high price of thirteen hundred dollars with very little features besides its editing equipment. The computer’s processing chip isn’t the best on the market, which makes the computer work slow a while after using. It’s a simple use for a computer with very little storage, but it keeps things organized and easy to find. Sometimes files tend to glitch out of the memory causing me to redo a few assignments. The screen has a clear picture, which makes it better when having to read and do homework. The computer itself is very clean and simple to use but doesn’t come with feature that most high-priced computer have.  After paying a heavy amount on a computer the features it has is limited compared to buying an iPad for the same price.",2697404359,18545

"I was able to snag one of these for $700 with the M2 MacBook Air arriving the day after I am writing this review. If it was in this price bracket all the time, it would be a no brainer best choice, and I am having a hard time finding worthy competition even at its $1,000 msrp range.What it does well:Trackpad-  The trackpad on the MacBook Air is unbelievable. Using pressure sensitivity to simulate clicks on a piece of glass, the MacBook lineup puts all other laptop manufacturers on notice. This is a best in class experience.Keyboard-  Say what you will about laptop keyboards but this is a phenomenal typing experience. The only type of keyboard I would rather be using is a mechanical keyboard, but in this form factor, it is as good as it gets. The only complaints I have are that the arrow keys are really small.Display-  The display provides a fantastic viewing experience. I thought this is where the laptop would fall behind its more expensive counterparts with OLED and Mini LED displays, but the color accuracy, respectable 400 nit peak brightness, and 2560 x 1600 resolution are leaps better than anything I have experienced on an HP or Lenovo device. I wish the display was slightly bigger, but do not mind using it at all. This is a very good display for the money.Build Quality-  Apple just continues to excel at building things.Speakers-  Solid speakers with exceptional clarity, volume, and bass. Better than anything I have owned before it.What it does bad:Gaming-  Do not buy this laptop with the hopes that you can game on it. Most games I thought of installing were not available on Mac OS. It is in this category that Windows dominates the market.IO-  You get 2 USB C ports and a headphone jack. This fits my lifestyle just fine, but I cannot speak for everyone. It is up to you to determine whether you can live without USB A, HDMI out, or SD Readers built in.Base Hardware-  At this price point, 256gb is not enough. 512 should be the standard, not a $160 add on.",2697390208,18545

"OMG! This is such an incredible product. Perfect keyboard, perfect weight, perfect battery life, perfect trackpad, perfect performance, perfect Touch ID, perfect feel, perfect build, perfect look, perfect size, perfect stereo sound, perfect screen, perfect noise absence as not having a fan! I mean, it doesn't have a fan and it doesn't get hot most of the times. WTF?! It's the only laptop I've been able to use in my bed for x amount of hours and it is sooo comfortable to do it. It truly is one of the best products out there and it is totally worth the investment, because that's how I see it, not even as spending, that's just how good it is. I'm enthusiastic because this is for sure the best device Apple has created in terms of price/what you get, and it will probably stay in that position for a couple of years. This is game-changing and revolutionary. The computer feels as if it will last 10+ years, honestly. I highly recommend it. BTW, it is so good my girlfriend decided to get one for herself because she just couldn't get over the first time she used it, and just how beautiful it is and pleasurable to look at from any perspective... This laptop is so ridiculously perfect that you can even open it with one hand and in just a couple of seconds, you will be ready to use it as it has an always-on feature that allows you to get down to the working right away. That is probably the best feat. True Tone is also really good, as it is automatic brightness adjustment and dark mode, they sit together perfectly well. Get it! You won't regret it at any moment. Truly a high-end experience. Oh, and... It looks elegant at any angle, and which is most important, classy it feels.",2697369698,18545

"The 2020 MacBook Air BigSur OS is one of the newest computers on the market at the moment and one of Apple’s best designs. Apple has had many MacBook models throughout their many years of being the best electronic company, but The BigSur OS has many features that other models and other company computers do not have. This MacBook comes with high quality upload speed, all-day battery life, and superfast memory, which makes it the best choice for any computer or laptop right now. For a student and any other user, upload speed is definitely one of the most important qualities on a computer. This MacBook’s upload speed is fast enough that it can be considered a gaming laptop also. It has an Apple M1 Chip with an eight-core CPU which delivers up to almost four times as fast as past generations. This M1 Chip is designed by Apple designers themselves which other companies do not have access to. This BigSur is the quickest computer on the computer and laptop market which puts Apple as the highest revenue electronic company. Battery-life is another quality that is essential to many people, especially a student in the year 2021. Many universities and high schools have switched to using mainly online tests, textbooks, notes, and activities. All day battery-life is important because some students are using their computer up to nine hours a day with school, homework, and studying for tests and quizzes. This MacBook uses lithium polymer batteries which provide up to 18 hours of battery life. These batteries also are good for the environment and conservation. These are the best batteries for computers because they provide the best life and are good for the environment. Good memory and lots of storage are also crucial qualities of a computer. This MacBook can be used for up to ten years if there are not any software problems. This MacBook has eight GB of unified memory that makes everything you do have fast upload speed and responsiveness. Having enough memory and storage is great. For example, a student or a teacher would need to save documents, projects, notes and many more things. If there is not enough storage to do those things that a student needs to do then things will end up lost and not recovered. A lot of storage is also needed for a gamer because there needs to be space to download the games and have room for any spontaneous updates that might occur. Good memory and storage are important to many people and that's what makes the BigSur OS the best computer on the market. The MacBook BigSur has many pros that other computers just do not have and is a reasonable price for all the features it comes with. This model is an amazing choice for students, teachers, gamers, engineers, IT workers, and anyone who uses their computer a lot. The MacBook BigSur OS definitely continues to be one of the top rated computers and gives users a big bang for their buck.",2697366431,18545

This is a very good laptop and easy to use.  A few things I've noticed is the backlit keyboard is very nice and adjusts automatically.  The keyboard is easy to type on and get used to and the touchpad is great.  The battery is extremely good too.I also use Apple Music and was pleased to find that spacial audio (Dolby Atmos) music songs played back on the Airs speakers and sounds amazing compared to high res stereo tracks.It's these little things I've found out about while using this computer that just amazes me all the time after just two weeks of ownership.  I would have bought it at Amazon but I could pick it up at my local BestBuy for 899 dollars when I got it.,2697362692,18545

"Through the past year and a half, students have had to use personal computers and laptops for everyday tasks, most importantly being school. From my personal experience I believe that the MacBook Air 2020 is the best tool for the job. If you plan to frequently use a personal computer or laptop in the future, the MacBook Air is the right choice because of its processing speed and storage, ability to keep a charge, and the apple compatibility that it uses.First, the MacBook Air 2020 is amazingly convenient to use throughout the day because of its ability to hold a charge and how quickly it gets charged. In my school days I did not have very much time to worry about the battery life of my computer. Now I do not have to do that at all because I only need to charge my computer once to twice a week and its 30 hour charge. Next, the apple compatibility that it uses, including Apple music, iMessage, Facetime, etc., makes this product very easy to use while not having to use multiple devices to do actions such as getting a photo from your photos or getting that one picture from a text. This apple compatibility lets you see all of these things and not have to worry about changing devices to do so. Finally, is the processing speed and storage. The MacBook Air 2020 has a processor that is considered to be great for gaming and running large applications within the computer. This makes the computer amazingly fast while doing average school work and using it for everyday life. Although it is expensive, the MacBook Air has been considered to be the best for its price out of all of the MacBooks, including computers such as the MacBook Pro. The strange thing that the MacBook has is amazing showing its slim appearance and lightweight feel. The storage that is available with the MacBook is 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB, but most went with 512GB. These large amounts of storage are fantastic, showing that one of the MacBook Air's biggest competitors(Dell XPS 13) only lets you choose between 128GB and 256GB. Now if you want to have a large amount of pictures or apps on your computer that kind of storage just won't cut it. For these reasons the MacBook Air 2020 is the best choice for daily use and school work because of its processing speed and storage, ability to keep a charge, and the apple compatibility.Overall, the MackBook Air has the processing speed, storage capacity, battery life, and the apple compatibility to make it the best choice for a laptop or personal computer. Throughout the last year and a half, I have had to be on my computer a lot to do school work and many other things. Getting this computer has not only helped me do this quicker, but has improved the quality of my work because of its nice layout and convenience.",2697362181,18545
"This is the best laptop I’ve ever owned for a few reasons.SPEEDIt’s lightning fast. The M1 chip almost never struggles, opening apps and web pages in seconds.SCREENThe screen is very high resolution with little glare. There’s NO TOUCHSCREEN, but I didn’t even notice until I’d owned it for a month cause I don’t use that.BUILD QUALITYIt’s sturdy, light, and durable. It’s powder coated so it doesn’t scratch easily, but when it’s not pretty.macOSThe operating system is great on its own, but with an iPhone it’s incredible. Messages, photos, websites, and mail from your phone just appear on your laptop.I don’t know if another laptop that hits all these points for under $1000.Now as for the cons…Not enough storage - 256gb is not enough. You can get by if all you do is browse the web and use Microsoft word, but for anything beyond that you’ll need AT LEAST 512gb.Gaming - macOS has a very small selection of gaming options. It’s not a gaming machine, but it’s laughably small.For the games it does have, the fps and speed is reasonable. It’s not incredible, but like I said it’s not a gaming machine.",2697360848,18545
"Macbook Review Apple has created many technological wonders throughout the time of the business, and the Mac is no exception. I have had different laptops before highschool, like Chromebooks, so I knew what I liked and did not like. After about two months of searching, I landed on the Macbook.  When researching which laptop to buy for highschool, I landed upon the Macbook for its reliable battery, the great software, and the modern features brought by the Macbook, like touch I.D. and Siri. The modern aspects of the Macbook are beyond great, and serve many purposes that other laptops fail to incorporate. The first one is fingerprint recognition. When I had old laptops, I always had to remember every character of the password, and it was just a plain hassle. Now, however, Apple has a fingerprint scanner built into the computer itself, which I find extremely useful. Between my school passwords, my home passwords, and other important information, that is a lot to keep track of. Now, though, all I need is my fingerprint and I can get into all of my accounts with my fingerprint. Also, the Macbook comes with Siri, a virtual assistant to do tasks and find different files on the Mac. There are many different papers, files, and websites needed to keep track of, and finding all those efficiently is almost impossible on your own. But, Siri makes it easier. To activate Siri, all you have to do is simply say “Hey, Siri” and the assistant will appear. Siri responds to what is said, so if I say, “Hey Siri, find ‘Review 2’ from Google Drive,” the document will appear seconds later. Although the modern technologies of the Macbook are important, just as important is the software. Many laptops lack the software that a high-end desktop would have, but this does not apply to Apple’s Macbook. First, the Mac has capabilities that of gaming desktop computers. Safari is the Mac’s main browser, so what happens if for some reason I need to use Google Chrome? Well, the Mac has the ability to run not only two but three different utilities at once, Google Chrome, Safari, and Bing. Also, the software of the mac allows you to also play desktop games when you want to. Most laptops are meant for business or school, like the Macbook, but not all of them can perform as well as the Mac for games. Sometimes, after school, I explore and test the limits of my laptop just to get a sense for what the max is. I expected the Macbook to do somewhat poorly, but I thought that it actually did pretty well. Another reason why the Macbook is great is because of the battery. The batteries for every computer seem the same, but once looked at in-depth, not all batteries are equal. The Macbook has a very long battery life compared to another laptop, like a Chromebook. When I first used my Macbook, I used it without charging it until it needed it. How long did it last after starting at 50%? Almost one day with no charge. The Chromebook I had when I was in middle school would need to be charged after about five hours of use. Also, the battery uses an optimizing system. When the battery is below 30%, the system turns the battery power done, and thus turns down the brightness of the screen. This helps to maintain the battery for a longer period of time. Not only is the battery great, but for many other reasons this is the best laptop I have had. The Macbook is a modern, efficient laptop for not only students but for all kinds of people. From the battery life, to the software and the modern features, the Macbook is a great laptop to use, no matter who you are and what you do. The Mac will change not only how to get things done, but your view of a laptop forever.",2697360353,18545

"Okay, this is a great MacBook, and a significant improvement over its predecessors, very fast laptop. As a student here are my pros and cons.PROS:-Portable for me to carry, I got a hard case for it and a sleeve and it is very portable at 13""-Battery life is fantastic, I literally charged it to 80% yesterday afternoon at 3:00PM, now, as I write this review, it is still going, at 4:06 PM, with 39%. In the past 10-12 hours, I've been using photoshop and Final Cut Pro, finishing my essay and FaceTiming a old friend, it is amazing-M1, the processor is super fast, even though this thing doesn't have a fan, it doesn't get hot at all, I have not seen this thing get warm a single time.-The keyboard, let me put it this way, it is VERY SATISFYING, many people have many opinions about it, but I come from using a MacBook 2017 and Asus Vivobook, this keyboard is very good, has great travel and it isn't mushy.-Display is also very good, gets bright enough, even in direct sunlight and keyboard backlight is adjustable, something I haven't been able to do on my windows laptops.CONS:-App support, plainly putting it, app support sucks other than applications that are optimized for the m1, even as of 2022, but my main apps work, like Final Cut Pro, photoshop and Lightroom.-Webcam sucks, it's still 720p, and much worse than my Asus, it's serviceable but not good.",2697354057,18545

"Over the past 10 years, I've had five MacBook Airs and three MacBook Pros (my employer provides a new one for my work every few years, and I upgrade my own at home every 1-2 years).  Most recently, my personal computer has been an early 2020 intel quad core MacBook Pro and my work computer an early 2020 MacBook Air.  The brand new M1 MacBook Air is my favorite by far, and fixes everything I didn't like about the MacBook Air & Pro introduced in early 2020.The M1 MB Air's battery life is amazing, I can use it all day and still have 50-60% battery remaining.  My previous MB Air and MB Pro gave me around 5-6 hours of battery life (despite Apple promising ~10 hours) - which was barely enough to get me through the day.I'm also loving the the fanless design, silent operation, and increased performance.  Even though I don't do much video editing, my workflow can be taxing on the computer:  I regularly run lots of apps simultaneously, including Zoom for teaching, many open browser windows, Excel & statistical/database software, and a connected iPad I use as a digital whiteboard when teaching over Zoom.  The new M1 MacBook Air handles this easily, and does not get hot despite the lack of a fan.  The MB Pro I've used since April (the one introduced in early 2020 with Intel quad core processors) also handles this load well, but it gets warmer and fans kick on sometimes.  The early 2020 MacBook Air buckled under this load, it gets very hot and the fans are screaming.Besides the better battery life, silent operation, and robust performance, the new M1 MB Air has a display with better colors and a slightly better webcam compared to previous MB Airs.The MB Air's display doesn't get as bright as the MB Pro's display - that has been true for years, but it has never been a problem for me.  I would only need the display to be brighter if I were working outside on a sunny day, and I just don't do that.I really love the keyboard on the new M1 MacBook Air, which is the same as the keyboard on the early 2020 MB Air & Pro, and MUCH improved IMHO from the butterfly keyboards on the previous MB Airs & Pros.  It is quiet and super comfortable for typing.  When typing very fast, my accuracy is higher on this keyboard than on the butterfly-style keyboards.This is subjective, but I really prefer the MB Air form factor - the wedge shape and slightly lower weight - compared to the MB Pro.  I also strongly dislike the MB Pro's Touch Bar.  I've had two different MB Pros with Touch Bars and they were nothing but trouble for me.  When typing fast, my fingers would sometimes slightly graze the edge of the Touch Bar, which would trigger a command (like launching the Music app), which would interrupt my workflow.  I know other people don't have that problem, and other people find the Touch Bar useful, but it's just not for me.For me, the MB Air speakers (on this and on the previous model) are quite good for movies or YouTube videos or Zoom/Facetime calls.  The microphone is perfectly satisfactory, though for Zoom calls or when making my own instructional videos I usually plug in a cheap external mic which is a little better.The webcam is still disappointing, even though image quality is SLIGHTLY improved over previous MacBooks.The external design is exactly the same as MacBook Airs from years past.  I like the design pretty well, but Apple will redesign the MB Air & Pro in the next year or so to reduce the bezels which will allow a bigger screen without increasing the size of the computer.  I will want one of those and might regret that I didn't wait.But for now, the M1 MacBook Air is the best MacBook I've ever had, it fixes everything that I didn't like about previous MacBooks (except the webcam) and offers me a really great computing experience in just about every way.",2697347703,18545
"This MacBook is excellent. I’ve had it for a year now and it’s impressing me more than I thought it ever would. Every day, straight for 1 year and it’s working like a beast, the only thing is to not eat over it as the keyboard gets pretty mucky and you have to get it deep cleaned. In conclusion, this computer is more than a beast than my old 2015 Macbook Pro",2697347098,18545

"I have both an iPad and iPhone so I thought is would be make sense to have a Mac so everything is in one ecosystem, as it were.  To some extent this has indeed proved true and useful.  I am coming from a Surface Pro 7.  The Mac Air's battery life is much less than advertised.  The claim is around 10 hours, I doubt I get 5, and I am mostly doing internet browsing and Word stuff.  Battery life from fully charged was about 1 hour while on Zoom.  The battery life of the Surface is better.  Word for Mac is a little different than Word for a PC, but the differences are minor and manageable.  But documents open more slowly on the Mac, and mine has the M1 chip.  On the Surface, documents usually open immediately.  On the Mac it might take 5 seconds, not an eternity, but a little annoying.  The Surface boots up much faster than the Mac.  I have a DVD with a number of workouts on it.  I could not get any individual workouts to open using the Mac's native software.  So I downloaded VLC.  It works fine on the Mac, but takes a long time to open, about a minute.  This seems to be true of any software not downloaded from the App store, including Firefox.  There do not appear to be Mac apps for either.  On the other hand, the Mac has a better screen than the Surface.  While the Surface is quite a good laptop, it is a marginal tablet, and I almost never use it as a tablet.  When I am not sitting at a desk, I prefer the Mac because the two parts cannot come apart as can happen on a Surface.  The new Mac keyboard works great, maybe a tie with the Surface.  So a mixed bag.  As I mentioned, I like having everything in one ecosystem, so likely that is enough of a benefit to keep the Mac.  I am mulling over upgrading to the MacBook Pro 13 because of its bigger battery, but don't know if I want to spend the extra money.",2697346287,18545
I've had this computer for a year now and I've gotta say this thing really chugs through a lot. I usually have a million tabs and the entire Microsoft Office Suite open and this thing just takes anything I throw at it. Only downside is that a lot of apps are not designed for the M1 chip and despite there being virtual desktops for Windows out on the market the performance is still a little shoddy.,2697345961,18545
"I was making the switch from Windows to Mac - I could play my games on this passive cooled machine with ease. Warcraft 3 and StarCraft worked no problem since they were converted to 64 bit. Problem is TF2 is still 32 bit and it will not run on my Mac. I got this Mac on special at Costco with the M1 chip. Amazing I can get 60 fps on a passive cooled chip. Great build quality and battery life. Poor application on apples part to prematurely discontinue 32 bit applications. That’s just unacceptable, and I had to return it. I will switch over to Mac in 10 years when apps are converted or no longer used.",2697345832,18545

"I love Linux, i can tolerate windows, usually don't like Mac. It's fine folks like what they like for me, Linux gives the most choice is extensible, and runs so fast on even older hardware, you get infinite support you don't get harassed to use cortana, siri, candy crush itunes etc etc.  Mac usually they push you so hard in this echo system for a lot of stuff i really don't like. it used to be just getting music out of itunes was a pain.well here we are in 2021. I mainly work on linux these days, and wanted a unix style mac because working remote i just needed something with microsoft office, i need that. i am not doing windows development these days. I know there is wsl but there are trade offs on windows. not with mac --  for my use case, so i tried it... gave it another shot really. My timing was seemingly really good. these computer are fantastic. You know what i hate about laptops. when they are 150 degrees melting your nuts and it sounds like you have a jet pack on. I hate that i really do. All of my laptops do this. The mac M1 I am pleased to report doesn't. Screw performance i mean that's great here, but the quiet and note heat that's the feature.This is coming from someone that doesn't want to like Apple. They outsource all these jobs, their stuff is over priced right? I'm not so  sure about the price here. You can buy a mac pro 13 inch that's faster than an i9 for 1500 (if you get 16gb), and the battery is amazing, no heat, no fan, the sound is great, the screen is great, the keyboard is great, it's not a lenovo, but other than that it's about as good as you can get. This machine is so well thought out. I got the pro, the reason i take a lot of calls and wanted the slightly better sound, and boosted battery,but if you don't need that you can just get the air which doesn't have the horrible touch bar. Don't get me wrong. the touch bar would be fine IN ADDITION to normal keys. that's where they went wrong here they got greedy. I digress. The only other issue i see here is the connectivity sucks. It needs ports on both sides and at least 2x ports.All these reviews are usually full of crap. It's just people getting free hardware and writing reviews so they can take a tax deduction, or they are sort marketing. This time it's true. This architecture is a significant advance especially in the laptop space. I 'm not sure if this will translate to a desktop-- risc vs cisc isn't new it been going on for decades, but  for laptops, this is a quantum leap. I don't see any reason for the work i'm doing to use a desktop computer a this point. i have complete portability, i can take calls (amazing calls), work on ms office, general development (vscode, all the jetbrains stuff, docker etc)... i mean for a lot of system stuff i'll still use I'd still use linux, but for work this is a great way to go. What a great product. It really really is. This i as strong of an endorsement i can give if you just need to be productive. After 8 months of hell no more fumbeling around with TPM chips, mics, no being able to share my screen, pleading with my computer to use the right audio device. I like it better than any other laptop i have ever had by far.This thing is really just that good. I've been i this industry for a long time. There are going to have to be some changes in competitors product lines, if Apple continues to maintain this price point and deliver a product of this caliber. I have no question this one is going to eat market share fast. I'd imagine there will be a strong response fro Intel, amd and the software companies.  It's difficult to justify purchasing any other laptop at this moment. I mean just get the air for 1200, just get the extra ram. maybe 500 gb. That's all most people are going to need. Who cares if they release better ones in 6 months. they always do they'll probably cost too much. this is all you need.",2697340315,18545
"I am a life-long fan of all things Apple.  That being said, after using this laptop for a little over a month, I am still impressed with how awesome this laptop is!  The battery life alone leaves me in awe.  I bought this laptop to use as an online student.  Starting with the battery fully charged, I am easily able to complete all of my online coursework and have plenty of battery power left to stream a movie or two afterwards.  I actually purchased my MacBook Air M1 laptop directly from Apple so I would get the student discount.  I did choose to upgrade my RAM to the 16 GB for an additional $180, and that did cause delivery to take a little longer.  Totally worth it though!  I have not done anything yet on this laptop to really stress-test it, but I have had multiple webpages in the browser, and multiple documents open in Word and PDF docs open with iBooks and Preview.  I have had no problems at all switching between open web sites, apps, or docs.  The only time I started to notice any hint of a problem, it turns out it was because we lost power and therefore our home WiFi was temporarily unavailable, so it had nothing to do with the laptop.While it is a minor inconvenience that Netflix is not available for download thru the app store at this time (Oct 2021), it is easy enough to access their streaming service thru the browser.  The built in speakers are plenty loud enough, but it is quite easy to use your AirPods if you prefer.I highly recommend this MacBook Air M1 to anyone, especially students, looking for a laptop that has a battery that will actually keep up with them all day long without constantly needing to find a power outlet.",2697339436,18545
"When I was in college, I used both mac and PC and after I graduated I switched exclusively to PC because of the versatility (gaming and upgradability). When I decided to go back to grad school, I decided to give Apple another chance with this laptop because I heard great things and high expectation with the new m1 chip design. I was not disappointed.This new CPU has great speeds and this macbook air runs fantastic for daily moderate use (browsing the web, watching videos, reading, studying, etc. ). I can go to a cafe and use this laptop all day without having to charge it. Also, it's so compact and thin that it's easy to take everywhere! compared to my old macbook from 2012, it is incredibly light. I always had the notion that apple made heavy laptops, but this definitely is easy to carry around.As someone who used a desktop, the keyboard was a bit harder to adapt to. The keys don't have a deep switch as a normal keyboard has, but considering the size of the laptop, it is expected. I can see it being an issue with its small screen. Although it is convenient for me, the size can be inconvenient for those hard of sight. Lastly, the price is steep for a laptop. A PC variant with this money can be used to buy a gaming laptop where Apple normally lacks, but I have yet to try the Apple Arcade on my macbook air. It is also only USB-C which is a turn-off to many, but with a dongle, it is not a problem for me.I would say if you are looking for a laptop to work or study with, this is an easy grab. Make sure you buy a dongle along side of it.TL;DRPros:- battery life- m1 chip- size (easy to carry around)- weightCons:- keyboard- size (screen is a bit small for some)- price- only USB-C",2697339190,18545
"I love this computer, just about everything is made so well on it. I have always been a fan of apple products; about two years ago when my old computer stopped working, I decided to get a MacBook and would absolutely recommend this product. One of my favorite things is the size, it is so easy to carry or fit into almost all bags. Due to the fact that I am an avid apple user, it is super beneficial that all my photos, passwords, and documents are so conveniently transferred to each of my devices. The only bad thing is some softwares are not supported within the apple computer which can be inconvenient for someone who may be a college student like me. Otherwise, the computer is great for college students who do not mind emailing the teacher or going through some loop holes to complete the class.",2697339169,18545
I have bought this laptop and now got confirmed with Apple support that my laptop is refurbished which is not mentioned in the listing.Manufacturer told me to solve this issue with Amazon but Amazon CS is telling me they can’t do anything as refund/replace time has passed.The listing is lying and they are selling refurbished laptops.One day my laptop just stopped working and now it cannot be fixed and I need to buy new one.Amazon is refusing to refund.Apple is telling to solve issue with Amazon as I bought it from there,2697338746,18545
"I'm new to Macbooks, having used Windows my whole life. I chose this for going back to school because I knew it would last longer and not get buggy like Windows always does. While the transition was a bit rocky at first, now that I somewhat know what I'm doing, I absolutely love this computer! It's small and lightweight, but still feel solid in your hands. The processor is incredibly fast as well as the load up time. I can get signed in and have my notes up in seconds (literally, no joke!), something I could never do with a Windows laptop (I should mention that I bought my computer directly from Apple and upgraded to the 16BG RAM and more storage, which helps immensely with load up time). For those that say the camera is bad- I don't think so. Is it the most amazing camera ever? No, but if you really need higher camera quality for your job, then you should probably go with a Macbook Pro instead of Air. For a Zoom meeting it works just fine. The price is obviously higher than many laptops- that's why I've never used Mac until now- but just think of it as an investment. I know I'll be able to use this for years to come!If you are looking for an efficient, reliable laptop with great performance, look no further!",2697338574,18545
"This product is really amazing, from the long lasting battery giving me about enough time to finish my work, and school work to doing other task on it. Even its M1 CPU making it faster to load websites, and files instead of waiting all day for something to load up, and with its 8GB giving me more then enough room just for school task, and work task as well.",2697338452,18545
Not happy with product. Apparently all I'm allowed to say.,2697338293,18545
This laptop is the best,2697337596,18545
"Before I begin, I’d like to clarify that I purchased this MacBook on Apple.com.I was kind of reluctant at first to purchase a MacBook due to the expensive pricing. But it was heard that apple products are long lasting and really good quality. I’ve had. Chromebook for 3 years, and the quality is not amazing. I’ve had to bring it for repair multiple times. It also shut down randomly. But not with this MacBook.The MacBook is soo beautiful, and sleek. The rose gold color is so elegant, and the keys are amazing. At the top right hand corner there is a small button that enables Touch ID which is so convenient and easy to work.By just saying “hey, Siri” my automated assistant is summoned and will help me with whatever I need. It comes with so many apps. And so many ways to customize your MacBook.I changed my profile photo, set a quote on my Lock Screen, changed my wallpapers, made widgets, changed my highlight color, accent colors and much much more.It’s so convenient for me to have my zooms open in one browser and the “pages” app open in another so I can take notes while my teachers gives lessons.As shown in the pictures, if you update your MacBook with Big Sur, you can download “Widgetsmith” and customize widgets! My entire MacBook’s aesthetic is so elegant and I just love it. Comparing this to laptops like HP and Dell, as well as Google, there are limited ways you can customize your laptop to your liking.I asked a couple of friends and family members who have MacBooks, and they have had them for 5+ years, without having to take their MacBooks for repair. I am hoping this will be my case as well.I can now message anyone from the messages app and the mail app.The camera quality is great too! It’s touched up my appearance with zoom and Google meet. and I’ve heard if you want a MacBook to edit, the pro is the way to go because the storage is bigger.The battery life is so great too! I’ve used it for 6+ hours starting at 9am to 4:30 pm. It started at 45 percent and it only went down to 30!!!Buying a MacBook will not water your money! I am loving every second of my use!!! Thank you Apple!!! 💜",2697337459,18545
Not a good computer,2697336016,18545
"I was hesitant to get a smaller Macbook after my 15"" 2015 Macbook Pro started to suffer from keyboard issues.  I repaired the keyboard twice, so there must have been something wrong with voltage regulation to it.Anyhow, I couldn't resist the idea of an ARM based Macbook, so I went with the 2020 13"" Macbook Air since I don't think the Pro model had Apple Silicon yet.  I could be wrong on that.Long story short, it meets all my needs with flying colors!  It turns out that I'm perfectly comfortable with a 13"" screen and that I don't need a bigger one.Everything great about this Macbook:- It's *fast*!  Don't let the ""Air"" moniker deceive you.  Unless you're into heavy gaming, this is the laptop for you.  ARM processors are the future of consumer computing.- The battery life is *insane*.  I still can't comprehend how many hours this thing survives unplugged.  I take it on flights across the country and never need to plug in or get worried that I will run out of power, even when I'm charging my phone off it!- It's slim and light!  Perfect for traveling.- It is completely solid state with no moving parts!  No fan whirring or anything like that.- As an extension of the first point, it runs ARM builds of Windows insanely well with Parallels.  It can even run Halo: CE at near full speed!- macOS is very stable.- The retina screen is nice.- Despite what people are saying about the camera, it's actually better than the one on my old Macbook Pro.  (this isn't to say that the camera is *good*, but it's adequate IMO)- All things considered, the M1 Macbook Air is incredible value and really a great deal for the price.- It has a larger touchpad than my old Macbook Pro but not quite as bit as the one on current 13"" Macbook Pros.  I find this preferable because it is just the right size where I'm not constantly hitting it with my palm as I type.  If you type a lot then the touchpad on this laptop will probably annoy you less while still having plenty of surface area.- No touchbar!!!  Halleluja!!!!- Decent sound from the speakers considering the size constraint.There are some cons, but they are pretty minor IMO:- Only the left side has USB-C ports, in contrast to the Pro which has them on both sides.  The right side *does* have an analog audio jack, however, if that's useful to you.  However, I've managed fine without USB on the right side.- It would be nice if I didn't have to click the fingerprint sensor button to get it to sense my finger and wake the system.  On pros, the fingerprint sensor is always active.- If you are one of the 3 people on the planet who want the touchbar, this will not have it. (I however consider this a good thing)- Although the speakers have improved in quality since previous Air models, the Pro is still going to have better sounding speakers.  You may feel like you've gotten a bit of a downgrade in that regard if you are coming from a Pro model.  Personally, I've gotten used to it plus I use AirPods most of the time anyway.- The Air does NOT have an HDMI port, but you can buy an (expensive) adapter that will provide HDMI.- Storage capacity is workable but limited.  Would be nice to get at least 1 TB of storage in the future.  In the meantime I just back stuff up on to an external drive and periodically clear my downloads folder.I'm a software engineer and the M1 Macbook Air exceeds my needs and expectations.  I think I'll just be buying the Air model in the future because it's terrific value for the price point.  $999 might be expensive for some, but I can assure you that it's a robust laptop so you are saving money in the long run.  I've owned many non-Apple laptops in the past and I ended up hating all of them.  On the other hand, I never regret owning an Apple device.  This is coming from someone who formerly used Windows and Linux.  I got tired of both the hardware and software breaking down quickly.  Apple isn't perfect... my last Macbook Pro chugged along for over 6 years until the keyboard repeatedly failed, but that still beats all previous laptops I owned that had numerous problems unrelated to how I treated them.",2697333357,18545

"I bought my Macbook Pro in 2013 which makes it 8 years old. It's still going strong. I did have to replace the battery a few years back. I did it myself, bit of a pain as Apple locks their stuff down pretty well. It looks like Apple will drop support for this late 2012 model next year. That's when I'll get a new one. Not bad for close to 10 years for one machine. About a hundred bucks a year.",2697327636,18545
"I've owned this laptop for a year and a half, and felt compelled to take time out of my frantic day to note that I really think this computer is a giant step backward for the Macbook Air model and for Macintosh as a brand compared to my old 2013 Macbook Air running Yosemite.The lack of a mag-safe connection for the charger is really unforgivable, and this computer has wound up on the floor so frequently that I now have placed the dog bed where the laptop is likely to land.  The keys are beginning to stick.  The screen is beautiful, but gives me a terrible headache.  The memory pressure issue with the M1 is also a real problem in Safari, which locks up about every three weeks if you have a lot of windows open-- and it take a LONG time to force quit safely and recover lost work.  The laptop is also too big-- that extra inch or so of width really makes a difference.  The loss of practical functionality in iTunes is really disappointing, iMovie and Garage band have become much, MUCH harder to use in Big Sur as well, and Apple's insistence on trying to force me into using the kloud is both intensely irritating and very dangerous for my business, where confidentiality is absolutely critical.It is true that the processing speed for offline tasks is impressive-- my music projects do sound much better-- and photo and video editing is great.But the M1's speed is not enough of a reason for me to bond with this computer.  As the months have rolled by, honestly, I've come to kind of hate it.  I'm looking forward to refurbishing my old Macbook Air, and I'm thinking this may be the last Apple product that I buy, even though I can't think of a suitable alternative.I am a 64-year old professional health care provider who has been in IT since the early 1980s, and while it's true that I have generally been very unhappy with how gratuitously awful the end-user interface of most tech products have become over the last quarter century, there are some computers that I have actually liked-- my old Macbook Air was definitely one of them.  This is definitely not.",2697326188,18545
It wouldn’t even turn on,2697324957,18545
I love the screen quality even tho it’s not touch screen I love it and it’s so easy to use and perfect for all my classes it’s super light and portable,2697324242,18545
"I absolutely love my new MacBook.  When it arrived I answered a few questions, connected it to my WiFi and off I went.  It has been a buttery smooth experience.  Keyboards are one of those things that are dependent on user preferences, but for me it's the best feeling keyboard I have ever owned.  Many professional reviewers agree it's terrific. The multi-touch pad is brilliant, and now that I know the many different combinations of fingers and movements I zip around getting work done.  For example a two-finger swipe right goes back to the previous web page, no need to hit that back button.  It is also custom configurable to your touchpad needs. What I appreciate most is the total cost of ownership value.  I bought Final Cut Pro X when it came out 10 years ago yet there was no charge to get the latest version downloaded from the App Store. It does everything I need without an ongoing subscription fee like others have.  I still can't get used to how fast it works, it took me an hour to render a video on my old Mac but this MacBook did it in just a few minutes.  And it's cool and quiet! I'm using a huge 70"" 4K monitor as my secondary monitor.  Battery life is ridiculous.  I plug it in every 2 or 3 days depending on my workload, which is several hours per day.  I think the web camera is fine for me and many notebooks use this same 720p size.  I join one Zoom conference per week, so it doesn't really matter. The one thing I hope gets updated with the next release are the ports.  I'm using a hub because it only has two thunderbolt ports. I recommend this notebook to all my friends and family.",2697324117,18545
"I got this MacBook Air for work, because my personal laptop is a 2019 Razer Blade, and while thin, it’s heavy and runs hot…like gaming laptops do.I decided to get a MacBook Air M1 256g for a work laptop, and had no real expectations for it. I’ve been very impressed.The quality is what you’d expect from Apple, sturdy construction, I love the keyboard, the display is solid and shows a depth that my other laptops never have. It has handled everything I’ve thrown at it, zooms, huge files of client contracts, browsing of course, I haven’t ever noticed it throttling due to a lack of a fan.It’s operating system is very user friendly too, some tasks that are a bit more difficult in a PC are astonishingly easy.

"The MacBook Air is a great purchase for a laptop. It has many new features that will be helpful for school and work. The laptop is affordable, portable, and has the new M1 chip. The way the laptop is affordable is because you will be able to pay for it monthly so you will not spend all your money at once. You will also be getting what you pay for with its latest features. It is also portable because it is light weight and slim. This will help you carry it anywhere you need to and will be very helpful if you go to college, since you will be carrying from class to class. Lastly, it has a new M1 processing chip. This M1 chip makes it better than any past MacBooks, it keeps you laptop running smooth and fast, it also gives you long battery life. I really do recommend you purchase the MacBook Air, it is worth buying.",2697316917,18545

"This MacBook Air, I think Steve Jobs would have a smile on his face if he sees it.  So fast, so light, the battery can seem to last forever.  You may think, for such a small volume, can they just put a battery it in, or just a screen and keyboard in it. No, they put the whole computer in it, and super fast, last super long on the battery.  I have used computers for more than 30 years and I have to say, this is the summit of our civilization.",2697313379,18545
"I bought 2 m1 macbooks when they came out, waited for delivery patiently. Canceled 1 B&H and bought 1 here and got the other from B&H. Ive been using macs since the colored clamshells.  I still have 12+ year old Imac as and afraid to say to jinx myself it but love the big imac that replaced it for my office a few years ago.  IM sloppy and like to sit in bed and watch youtube while working or doing whatever I need to.  To the meat, these have both had quite few issues. Mine had the control key get stuck and by the grace of god and yt vids, I used sloppykeys or whatever it was after athourough cleaning to make it work.  My partner, I shut theres and apparently a piece of rice was near the trackpad and when we opend it the screen was broken, not cracked but no longer vicible.  Ive had so many macs develop issues. The biggest one they made was over 2k many years ago and had the known logic board failure.  I didnt know until after, my logic board died , even though faulty, they wouldnt cover past warranty.  Making a faulty product in america means anything after a certain time no longer counts even though it was they who made something that would fail.  I have 2 last gen macbooks both missing keys so external keybpoard only.Apple makes products with a lot of flaws. i think they were excellent back 10+ years ago but now I dread the company. i stopped buying iphones after mutiple died for various reasons, charger ports. etc. using sloppy cheap android now.  your identity should not revolve around corporations, were wasteful and gross.  Now Im down one macbook and not wanting to buy another with protection racket coverage but why pay more for a an m2 w pretty muc no difference or a 14"" for twice the price.A companies politics of greed and un-excellence makes me hate buying from them but to my not caring to re=learn (I have a chrome book to un-apple but dont like it) . OS i guess I;; buy another of the same less than 2 years later w applecare which Im sure iwll be great to handle.

"I bought this laptop last year for work and school and have had nothing but problems with it. My calendar randomly deleted most of my events and it commonly will not load or displays other problems. Apple has been garbage lately, and my phone was even causing problems with data issues and battery problems. I went and bought all Windows devices so I have more control over the technology.",2697312500,18545
"Full disclosure, bought from Best Buy open box for a much better price and convenient same day pick up.Shouldn't surprise anyone, build quality is top of the line, feels ultra premium, track pad, screen and keyboard are perfect. Screen is actually amazing, makes a huge different coming from even an IPS windows laptop. Fanless is truly fantastic, laptop stays cool with demanding tasks while sipping battery. I sat there for 5 hours doing some serious writing and safari browsing, and barely lost ~20%. I'd imagine you could get a couple days with casual/moderate use.This laptop solves all the problems of the previous Air's, it doesn't get super hot and the fans kick on obnoxiously loud. Performance is top notch, and the only real downfall is the lack luster webcam, but I'm not knocking off a star because every laptop has at least one compromise. This is a compelling package for the price, especially if you get more than 3 years out of it which is very doable. Overall was very impressed with this machine coming from a Ryzen 3500u Windows laptop.Edit: Be warned, buying from Amazon is a hassle when it comes to returns. With expensive products like this Macbook, you will need to jump through hoops just to get permission to return and the only option is a UPS pickup which is very inconvenient. Just a heads up, unless you want to end up with Amazon tech support for hours.",2697311092,18545

"This M1 is such a leap ahead for Apple. It has great battery life, no heat, and is fast and versatile. I  ordered the 512 model, but as a casual user, I don’t know if I will ever use all that memory. I think that many people could order the 256 base model, and save some bucks. An external drive is cheaper than built in memory. The fingerprint sensor is wonderful!",2697307598,18545
"okay so, pretty great laptop. it doesn’t overheat, the camera is better than my previous macbook, and it runs pretty well. the only problem i have is that extensions like chrome keep crashing. as a student using google meet and zoom for 7 hours a day i really can’t be crashing in the middle of a class. i’m not big on tech, so i’m not that picky, but i hope this problem sorts itself out.",2697306294,18545
"I encourage people who have had a bad taste left in their mouth by older (Intel) MacBooks, like myself, at least try out an M1 machine in person and see the difference.Compared to my older Core i5 MacBook: no more ridiculous heat and fan noise, no hit on performance with a bunch of apps open, and I could continue this list but *oh my god the battery.* I will watch a few YouTube videos, listen to music, edit some documents then check the battery percentage... to see it has gone down at most a handful of %, on pretty high brightness. It's a remarkable accomplishment that will surely change the way I use and transport my laptop. App compatibility has not been an issue for me at all, but it's worth I do not use any niche developer / engineering tools.",2697305937,18545

Chrome has not posed any issues so far with many extensions and two profiles running simultaneously as of the time of writing mid december.  8gb of ram is more than enough to run a multitude of apps thanks to apple's strong os optimization.This one is a keeper, I've been trying out macbooks for awhile and was always unhappy with something. Don't get me started with the battery life, it is so good that I spend most of my time off the charger.Most average joes looking for a daily driver or work from home computer will be satisfied with this.  As long as apple continues to support the first gen of desktop silicon for a long time like everything else, then I have no doubt this will last for a long time.",2697303008,18545
"I have had this MacBook Air in the gold color for a few months now. This is actually my very first MacBook. I absolutely LOVE it. First of all, it is gorgeous. I am a sucker for cute packaging or a cute product, and this laptop is just stunning. I have never seen a beautiful laptop until I got this.The performance is amazing as well. Super long battery life; I rarely have to charge it. Super thin. Never gets hot. Super fast. The 4k performance is beautiful. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. Definitely worth the price.  I looked at all of the MacBooks in person before buying, and the Air is just stunning with its thin design. Did not like the looks of the Pro models!",2697302920,18545

"Yup.  This M1 MacBook Air is everything the online reviewers said it was--amazingly fast, agile, and smart.  It blows away all earlier MacBook Airs as well as most other laptops on the market.  I'm not much of a tech nerd, so the specs and numbers don't mean much to me.  I'm a writer.  So I appreciate the feel, ease, and portability of the machine.  Plus, I'm delighted with the keyboard--heads and tails better than the faulty ""butterfly"" keyboard on my old 2017 Air.  All in all, this is a great small laptop.  Solid, but light.  Lightning fast and nimble.  It is a great step up from the older Intel machines.  And I'm not in the least bothered that the external design is the same as the older models.  It's a classic and fully functional shape, so why change?  Well done, Apple.",2697301312,18545

"The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip is overall amazing! It’s definitely worth the money! The all-new chipset has turned the Air lineup into a beast! My only complaint is the camera. Apple has stuck to the same 720p camera and claiming the neural engine makes it better? I’m not convinced it’s any better, and it’s really a disappointment compared to other notebooks in its class. Also, the inability to adjust the keyboard brightness from the keyboard. It’s adjustable from the settings and easily accessible… but it’s just an inconvenience. It’s a petty complaint but for the money, this should be standard (it previously was on older models). Aside from that, this notebook is amazing! Lightning fast and the best battery life I’ve ever seen! Overall, if you’re in the Apple ecosystem and you’re looking for an amazing laptop with all day battery life - this is the one for you!",2697299891,18545
The product was great at first. But after having it for a little over a year it completely stopped working (not turning on and a complete black screen) and there was no physical or liquid damage to it. And Apple wants me to spend $500 to fix the laptop that was just over a year old. Terrible customer support policies.,2697299524,18545
"I got this because my 2015 iMac was having trouble with video editing. Everyone said the M1 chip was so powerful that this thing would be able to handle most video editing with no problem, and at first that seemed right. It lags less when I'm actually editing. But today I exported a video with a very simple blur filter and this thing can't even play the exported video without freezing. Tried restarting and everythingAbsolute garbage for the money, this thing is just an overpowered internet browser",2697298142,18545
I'm a big techie and after seeing all the benchmarks had to get the M1. It's truly a game changing processor. My wife and I love this laptop. There's a slight adjustment as I'm a lifelong Windows user but MacOS is intuitive enough that it's not too bad. I tried to make the switch with Safari but it lacks profiles so I'm on the Brave browser. Brave works great and have had no issues so far. I also use signal and Bitwarden and both work fine.Apple really knocked the ball out of the park with this machine. The one true con is the crappy webcam. Aside from that this is the best laptop money can buy on the market hands down.,2697297214,18545

Upgraded from Mid 2015 base Macbook Air. This thing is like 100x faster. It is amazing. I got used to the USB-C and bought a little hub that makes it a non issue. Actually like it better since USB C is faster. Battery life on my old MacBook was amazing. This one is literally at least double that. Pro tip do not use chrome on any Mac or MacBook it is energy and efficient and will kill your battery (took me a while to learn this). Webcam is only bad part but all Macbooks have substandard webcams compared to iPhones. I got the base model and do NOT regret it one bet- I saved a ton of money on one less core and I do NOT notice a difference (heard its 10% or less). This thing is razor thin!,2697296843,18545
"Granted I'm coming off a MBP 8/500 dual-core i5, but this thing is read-my-mind fast.  I keep quitting apps out of habit when you just don't need to.  Keyboard is back to pre-butterfly goodness, sound is great, and with a dock like the Anker 7-in-1 you will not mind the port count.  GarageBand and iMovie never miss a beat.  On geekbench, these new M1 units are surpassed only by the xeon Mac & iMac Pros and the 8-core i9 iMac.  Same no-go apps as Catalina, so no real surprises.

"My son loved his Apple laptop while it worked. The screen has cracked twice. As we can see from the image, it cracks from the top middle where Apple put the camera. My son used the laptop a lot, but he did not mistreat his laptop. I generally do favor Apple products. Apple already repaired this once. I paid nothing for that repair. However, it has now failed twice for the same issue. I feel this is a serious engineering defect. I likely will take it to Apple so they can diagnose it. I don't particularly care if I get the laptop back or not at this point since I suspect it may break again within six months. Unfortunately I cannot recommend the Apple Macbook Air due to this defect. I do expect a laptop to last at least 2 or 3 years. Apple normally makes great products and I hold Apple in high esteem. This product unfortunately is not one of them. Not all of the Apple laptops will face this issue. But if you search the web you will find others who have experienced this same problem. I am hoping Apple stress tests newer versions of their laptops to address this issue in the future. Apple may need to modify the camera assembly or display assembly. Or relocate the camera to a different location like the corner of the display.",2697294263,18545
"I’ve been purchasing on Amazon and never get disappointed. This laptop is gorgeous and LOOKS BRAND NEW! I can’t afford brand new laptop due to other school expenses and so I was so excited to buy it. You’ll only end up returning this laptop at the end. Also, I came back to see if there’s new buyer but the price caught my attention. They higher up the price and with $900 you can afford to buy brand new MacBook Air M1.",2697293690,18545

I didn't think I would notice much of a difference, but I am very impressed with the speed and the battery life of this new edition. I mainly use my laptop for emailing, paying bills, and web browsing, and I purchased this model instead of the Pro because I don't edit or shoot videos. This model is perfect for my needs.",2697288697,18545
"This review is for the MacBook Air.  Bought this brand new, not refurbished, in November 2021.  Frequently clear history and reboot, and even that does not really help.  Sometimes it has normal page loading, but about half the time, it is slow, slow, slow, even with all apps but safari closed.  I only use it for surfing the web, no gaming, but it is SLOW.  Pages frequently take over a minute to load, regardless of the website.I called Apple, which says it has no authenticated reports of this issue.  I have ordered an Acer now so that I will have reliable internet access but I think this Apple for the price should have provided that.",2697288363,18545

"Apple USED to make great computers... Past tense! I've used them for many (almost 20) years but recently bought this computer in December and my sentiments about this brand has completely changed. How the mighty have fallen!I was always the biggest Apple supporter. I have purchased many as gifts for relatives as well as bought them for myself. From the Apple watches to the screens and desktops to the macbook pros, macbook airs and phones. I defended them against the Apple haters and always had their backs. I thought I was going to be Apple for life. I even own many shares of their stock, which I will be dumping soon because I see the writing on the wall. I could tell something was up with them as Apple continues to have great earnings reports but their stock doesn't move. It's the biggest slug of a stock. I now think I have stumbled upon the reason why.If you google the recent complaints about Apple you will see. Apple does not have the great customer service they once had. I was mistaken to think they did. They have also started cheaping out... big time. The result? Products that don't last. Couple that with customer service that could give a flying eff if you remain a customer of theirs and I'm sensing a recipe for disaster unfolding here... Selling all of my $AAPL stock ASAP stat.Warning, do not buy this computer! Apple's quality has gone wayyy downhill.The MacBook Air cords are absolutely horrendous! I am on my third Apple cord in less than 6 months. I brought the product to an Apple store and the employee denied that there was any problem with their cords and instead blamed me. He told me I must be doing something wrong. Nothing has changed about my usage of their products. I've always used them the same way and never had issues with my cords until the computer was really old. Think years and years. Not months. So you'd think if I was the problem like this guy tried to say I was, I'd be going through computer cords right and left, right? Well I haven't. And looking up my account would prove that. However, Apple doesn't care. They want to charge me for to replace their defective products anyway.Welcome to the new Apple where the customer is always WRONG.Then the guy doubled down and told me that he'd been working at the Apple store for 10 years and I'm the ONLY person who has ever had a problem with their cord. A simple google search has proved that to be completely false. Everybody complains about the quality of their cords. This must be huge business for them selling cords like this.So the employees gaslight you and will blame you if something goes wrong. If you want to sign on for that, good luck. I hope you never run into a problem and see what I'm talking about but you'll be fooling yourself because it will only a matter of time. I am DONE! I work too hard for my money and they aren't the only computer show on the road. Lucky for me I speak PC too.Thanks for nothing Apple! Good job burning that bridge. You just lost a loyal customer over $19. Hope it was worth the extra $$$$. It's not the money Apple. It's the principle. I won't do business with companies who treat me like that, period. Peace out!",2697280036,18545
GREAT!!! Came on time!!!,2697278644,18545
"Beware:  reliability and customer support is gone.  I bought a MacBook Air about 2 years ago. From the beginning, it malfunctioned, intermittently failing to allow me to access any other apps besides the one I was using.  I worked with numerous Apple technicians who also witnessed the problem.  After hours and hours over months of patiently working with them, I was told we’d try a complete replacement of the OS and if that didn’t work, I’d get a replacement. When it didn’t, I was told I’d now have to take disk images and record dates and times it failed. They’d have the “engineers” get involved.  “The engineers” for one faulty laptop after I’d been patient for two years doing everything they asked, and they witnessed the problem.  Two years, hours upon hours of my life and a false commitment to make it right. I’ve been a Mac user for decades.  No longer.  Given the premium price + AppleCare, I feel cheated and so disappointed.  I’ll be looking for a new non-Apple laptop.",2697277716,18545
"If you purchase the MacBook Air with the M1 chip YOU WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO RUN WINDOWS ALONG WITH MAC OS!  If your buying specifically to just use the Mac OS & don’t have a problem not being able to run Windows or any program that runs on Windows, then this system is a good Apple product.  If you are like myself (or want the option like you SHOULD JUST HAVE as has always been offered in the past with processors before the M1 and run Windows on a partitioned drive either with MAC OS, or boot up into Windows instead, the M1 chip now takes that ability to do so away!  The MacBook Air itself with the M1 chip now that they’ve finally incorporated the ability to run iPhone apps on it is in itself a huge breakthrough.  That was overall my biggest frustration with using MacBooks by a long shot.  And it seems they’ve fixed that now, so on one end impressive if your simply not needing Windows or anything that runs in the Windows environment of course.",2697277366,18545
"I was using a 2015 MacBook Pro for doing video editing for my church, and when I saw the specs on the M1 based MacBook Pro, I upgraded for faster processing.  My existing system has an Apple monitor, wi-fi keyboard and mouse, and a WD 3 TB external drive.The two USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro are inadequate!  I also bought a new 27"" LG monitor because I couldn't figure out how to use the old monitor with the new computer.  The LG monitor has 4 USB-C ports on the back, so I assumed would give me enough connections for my devices.  WRONG!!!!!Only one of the LG ports is Lighting compatible, so I had to use it to connect and power the laptop.  I had to buy a USB-C to Displayport adapter, plus a Displayport to Firewire adapter to connect my external drive, but this wasn't supported over the monitor's USB-C ports, it had to be connected to the remaining Lightening port on the laptop.  This consumed all the easily accessible ports!Then I had to buy a USB-C to USB3 adapter to connect my camera and other devices to the computer.  All behind the monitor.  It's a royal pain!  I've got it working, but I'm unhappy with the cludge.  I don't understand why Apple put together such a capable laptop with so limited connection capabilities.  I'm going to be d*****g with this terrible configuration for years.On the positive side, their claims of faster processing are true.  I can put together a church video, then export it to a file in 1/2 the time as my old laptop.  Even the upload speeds to YouTube seem to be faster.",2697276975,18545
Best one I had ever,2697273542,18545

"I have ONLY owned and used Apple computers/phones for the last 35 years.  This is the worst one yet.  Bought it for my online job come to find out it has the SLOWEST WIFI ... ""A Known Problem"" by Apple as well.  Yet though don't tell you or even Fix it.  Super disappointed.  My macbook air 2013 has faster wifi speed than this one.Buyer BEWARE",2697272123,18545
"The only computers I've ever owned have been Macs, starting with a Mac SE in 1987. This is the first time I've bought one that has mainly made me angry.I quickly discovered that I couldn't plug it into my printer because it doesn't have a USB port, so I had to buy a USB-C to USB adapter: $19.I also can't charge it using any of the chargers around my house from my old MacBooks or my husband's MacBook, so in order to have an extra charger, I had to pay $49. When it arrived, I realized it didn't come with a cord. Another order; another $19.And Apple is no longer using MagSafe connectors, so if you accidentally hit the cord with your foot or whatever, the cord doesn't just pop out of the computer. Instead, it drags your computer with it. Yesterday, just a month after getting my expensive new computer, I dragged it to the floor and broke the screen. It'll cost me $500 to get it fixed, if I don't decide to throw it into a dumpster.I now officially hate Apple. What's especially annoying is that they've successfully addicted me to their products, and I know I'm not going to change brands at this point in my life, so I'm going to keep having to put up with this kind of crap from Apple, plus how they're always trying to invade my privacy and force me to use iCloud and how their software now tries to make way too many decisions for me.I'm writing this review on my old 2015 MacBook Air and, even though it's slower than the new MacBook and the display is smaller and not as nice, I'm wondering if I really want to fix my new MacBook.",2697271831,18545
Apple is not standing behind this product.  We bought this laptop in 12/2020.  We activated it but my husband changed his mind.  It sat in our office for 1 1/2 years  We just plugged it in for my granddaughter for college and it won't charge.  Apple wants $428 to fix with only 90 day warrantee.  It has no trade in value and was never hooked up to the internet.  So sadI have a much older MacBook Air that has been fine.,2697270545,18545
"The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one.",2697269563,18545
"Owned a 2016 MacBook Air that had display issues from the get-go, but Apple said it might be okay if I was super careful handling it.  I couldn’t go without a laptop for 2 weeks so decided to risk it.  After a couple yrs of being super careful the display became distorted after just a slight bump, and after the warranty period of course.  Used it hooked up to the TV only for about a year, but as that was difficult in itself (overheating, prevented sleep function, etc), had to change course.  Didn’t wanna pay $550 for a new display, so…… bought the M1 2020 MacBook Air instead. Seemed to be operating well until 8 months in, when I wasn’t even anywhere near it and the display went totally out.  Wouldn’t turn on after repeated powering down so called Apple.  They had me power on with that shift-control for 10 secs and it went on again. However, considering my experience with my last laptop took no chances and brought it in to Apple.They ran diagnostics and found that the ambient light sensor wasn’t working.  That’s what automatically dims and brightens the screen when going into dark or bright places, in case you, like I, didn’t really know what it did.  Had never dropped this or mishandled it in any way.Sent in my laptop for repair and it’s now been more than a week without and they’re still “diagnosing” it.  Luckily my old laptop is still semi-functional if I hook it up to my TV.  And I still had a few months left in the warranty.  But what if it didn’t and I didn’t have the old one still functional?Two times in a row MacBook Air with serious display issues in the last 5 yrs, with no accidental damage from me. Aside from this, has superior speed and processing power, doesn’t overheat, but still takes 20-30 sec to power up and the touchpad functionality and the feel of both it and the keyboard are terrible when compared to the 2012 I used to have.If you buy an Apple laptop now Apple care plus is almost mandatory.  Will have to seriously consider going back to Windows for my next laptop.",2697268846,18545
"(Heads-up, this review will be lengthy, but I wanted to cover every aspect to make sure you make the right buying choice).The MacBook Air has always been known as a popular choice for college students over the years due to the lightweight, slim design and good battery life. One caveat that has always plagued the MacBook Air of year’s past was underwhelming performance due to underclocked, lower-powered processors (which were always reserved for the “Pro” line). That was why I always got a MacBook Pro in year’s past. This time around, when Apple announced the new M1 chip, I was curious, so I watched hours and hours of reviews and decided to pull the trigger on the new Air (the Air has the same chipset as the MacBook Pro, with the same GHz at 3.2, while saving $300). I am on a budget, but I also didn’t want to sacrifice performance, so I was a little nervous I was missing out by not getting the Pro, but thankfully I have not had to sacrifice a thing.I am a full-time digital design student, so my workflow can be demanding at times with running Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign, etc. I previously purchased a 2017 MacBook Pro and it was my daily driver until about mid-March when I made a grievous error and went out and purchased a Lenovo Yoga C940 with 16GB of Ram, Intel i7 Processor at a whopping price tag of $1500.00. Buyer’s remorse soon followed as the Yoga was plagued with overheating issues, thermal throttling and absolutely horrific battery life. The only thing that I liked was the speaker set-up and the 4K touch screen. Other than that, I was beyond disappointed. I sent it back, and went back to using my 2017 MacBook Pro, until I purchased this Air.So the pro’s:Fantastic battery life—I have a tough time killing the battery on this computer. It will easily last an entire day, and even longer if you aren’t totally hammering this thing with demanding apps like I do. It’s great to know you don’t have to always carry a charger with you everywhere (you can carry from class to class, the coffee shop and back home and it’ll still have battery to spare). A win in my book.Heat management and fanless design—I am super nit-picky about heat management and fan noise when it comes to laptops, which is why I always love the MacBooks and detest Windows (hence sending the Lenovo back).  The fact that this computer is fanless and manages to stay cool to the touch boggles my mind. I don’t have to worry about a computer than will get so hot that you can fry an egg on it, or annoying fans kicking on. I also like that I don’t have to worry about blocking any ventilation grills, since there is no fan. I can sit in bed with covers under this and not worry I’m blocking a fan exhaust.  Again, another win in my book.Slim design—at 2.8 pounds, and having a tapered design, you can throw this thing in a backpack and not feel like you’re lugging around a brick. I also liked the tapered design as it’s a little more ergonomic than my MacBook Pro that has some really sharp edges by the trackpad. It’s a nice change for someone that has to type up essays all of the time.Keyboard—gone are the butterfly mechanisms of MacBook’s past. One thing I really missed when I gave up my 2015 MacBook Pro was the keyboard! Thankfully with the new Air and Pro’s, you get the scissor switch mechanisms back, so my fingers don’t feel like they’re hitting bottom when typing for long periods of time.Trackpad—I love, love the force touch trackpad. I still believe Apple has one of the best trackpad designs of any laptop out there. Hands down. It’s smooth as butter.Performance—This is the little machine that could. It puts my 2017 Pro to shame. It also outperforms the Lenovo that was supposed to be top of the line, at a fraction of the cost. I can have multiple tabs in Safari open, Photoshop, Apple Music, Microsoft Word, and this doesn’t even break a sweat. I also like that I can do some light video editing on this. For most people—especially college students—this computer’s power should be more than sufficient. Keep in mind if you are a professional videographer or photographer, you might want to opt for the Pro as it does have a fan and can sustain heat management better in terms of thermal throttling. Again, that’s if you’re editing like multiple 4K videos on a daily basis, but for college students or the average Joe that may only need to do the occasional video project—no problem! This computer can handle it!Screen—It’s nice and bright, and the color accuracy is on point, which is important if you edit photos or videos in any capacity like I do.Speakers—I am a music junkie, and I have to constantly have music going when I’m working on school projects, and for such a thin and light laptop the speakers on this are actually pretty good. Good stereo separation and punchy. They could do with a little more bass, and when you max the volume it can get a little faded, but that’s to be expected for such small speaker drivers. I am more than pleased with them. They also work good for binge-watching shows on Netflix.The cons (there are few):The webcam—it’s a 720P webcam, and well, it looks like a 720P webcam. It’s a little grainy and washed out. It will do in a pinch, but you’d think in 2020 we’d get an upgrade on the webcam.The lack of ports—in true Apple fashion, the I/O is somewhat lacking. You have 2 thunderbolt 4 ports, of which you cannot plug in an external GPU, and are limited to one external monitor (this is a limit that Apple’s M1 system on a chip, not the thunderbolt ports, which I am sure will be resolved in future iterations). I would have liked to have seen at least one USB-A port for legacy things like flash drives, etc. But that’s just me being nit-picky.M1 chip running Intel apps—because Apple’s M1 chip runs on ARM and most apps are coded for Intel, there are many apps that have not been optimized to run the new Apple chip natively (like Adobe Creative Cloud). You might run into a few glitches and hick-ups while app developers are getting up to speed. So far, I haven’t really run into any issues, but there is that possibility. I am sure here soon it won’t be a problem. Again, it’s nit-picking.--To sum up: this MacBook Air is a winner. I would absolutely not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, and I would absolutely buy it again. You get the performance and the portability, while saving some $ by not buying the Pro line. I am very happy with this computer and think I might just have come as close as I can to the perfect laptop for my needs.Happy shopping!",2697268715,18545
"I very recently purchased (from the Apple Store, not Amazon) a bran new Macbook Pro with M1 chip. Buyer beware!!!! I've been a Mac and Apple user exclusively for the last 15 years or so. I cannot express how bad this M1 mac is. I bought it for work (professional audio, recording, live audio, Protools etc.) and it literally failed at everything that I needed it to do.Once I got back from a 7 week run on the road with a musical act, I tried to return the computer to the store, but to no avail. It was past the 2 week return window. Apparently Apple does not stand by their product anymore. They wouldn't refund me or even exchange it for a different model (with Intel chip). So I spent $1600 on a new computer that literally failed at all the work tasks that I really needed it to do and there is no recourse. Not to mention that for $1600 you get 2 thunderbolt/usb-c ports. Because of this I ended up purchasing a high quality docking station ($280) and still some of the features that I was counting on like the AVB network protocol would not work on this M1 Mac (unless you buy 2, yes 2, Apple adaptors to use in tandem). Sounds like a rip off right? I've literally spent days and hours on the phone with support from Apple, Windows, Parallels, OWC, Kensington and at the end of the day the M1 mac just isn't compatible with so many things.I've been a staunch Apple user and fan for many years, but this experience might just bring me back to Microsoft.Please stay clear of these M1 macs and don't count on the Apple store to provide you with excellent service (unless you are about to hand them over a few thousand dollars for a new computer that underperforms).For $1600 + $300 (for docking station and case) I got a bunch of disappointment, stress, frustration. Literally the worst purchase I've ever made.Regarding the Apple Store where I made the purchase: They apparently are in the business of taking a customer's money, but not in the business of providing said customer with anything else except a bad product.",2697266863,18545
"First, I will say I bought this at an Apple store, not on Amazon.  So this is a review of the product.  For many years, I have found Apple products to be overrated and overpriced.  That includes this product.  For example, as others have stated - no good ports (you need to buy all kinds of attachments), no touchscreen, etc.  And, of course, there are compatibility issues with anything not made by Apple.  But my biggest beef is that it is not reliable.  I recently downloaded Monterey - and am having all kinds of problems.  I find all these 5 star reviews hard to believe.",2697266478,18545
"This is our second Macbook Air.  The first one lasted nearly 5 years and was a rock-solid laptop. The new m1 machines are garbage. Do some research on the internet. The screens break and Apple denies there is a problem.  We have had this one for about 8 months and the screen just broke a second time.  I've paid $200 for Apple care and $100 twice to replace a screen.  We did NOTHING to the screen. no signs of abuse, a bump, a scratch, NOTHING. just open one day and the screen is black and pixelated. The break is internal. When its not broken, its a great computer.  Just be ready to buy it several times over replacing the screen.mIf you are already a victim, there are law firms taking cases.  Apple ought to step up and just deal with the defect.  Forcing customers that have been loyal to the brand to join in a class action suit in order to deal with the know and ongoing problem is awful.  Too bad they are so big they just don't care.",2697265099,18545
"Purchased this laptop in November (half a year ago) but did not really start using until the spring semester (end of January). About a month ago, I randomly opened my laptop to find colored lines across the screen. No damage to the phone as most my classes were remote and I was using my computer on my desk. It ended up going away on its own after shutting it down for 2 hours, but lines continue to reappear every few days or so then disappear after I let it rest. I looked it up online and it seems to be a hardware issue but I do not know how to fix this since I did not cause the problem. Never installed anything additional on my laptop besides google chrome and R software for research. Do not go through Amazon to purchase mac products.",2697264967,18545
"Overall, I love it. However, with that said there are some serious cons to consider before purchasing.1. Terrible camera--super grainy. This is unfortunate for a time that the majority of us are working at home or are reliant on FT for communication.2. It's important to be mindful, and as most techs will admit, this is easily apple's worst M chip--it will only get better! In the meantime, however, this Mac is super fast!I use it for school, work, and casual browsing. If that's what you're looking for, I recommend it. If you're looking for the best of the best, wait until they fix this camera.",2697264789,18545
"Junk.  For $1000, I'm gonna need a little more than a 256GB ssd that can't ever be upgraded or replaced because it's soldered to the MB.  When the SSD goes, the whole thing is worthless.  Or inversely, if the MB dies, you can't remove the drive to get your data.  It's like they are trying to fill up landfills with garbage on purpose.",2697264716,18545
It amazes me how much praise Apple seems to be getting for an out dated design and user interface.  Where is the touch interface and pen input especially since it is supposed to run IPad apps?  Where is the flexibility of a 2 in 1 that we have had available for years?  Apple has basically given us a fast dinosaur with a pretty face.,2697264220,18545
"Apple makes an incredible product. But their contempt for the customer knows no end. This is especially exemplified by the reduction of ports to only two on the MacBook Aires and even some Powerbooks. And EVERYTHING is put into those two. The separate power port is gone. The separate video out port is gone. In some cases, even the audio out port is gone. All they leave you with is two USB ports which they expect you to use for everything. For a lot of people, like myself, multiple ports are needed for constant use. They are needed for external hard drives (especially for file backup where you don't want to use the Apple Cloud which is susceptible to NSA snooping), external DVD and CD burners, special printers that do NOT work with Bluetooth, special mice for people like myself with handicaps that make trackpads difficult, drawing pads, etc. etc. etc. And don't tell me to just get an external hub. I have tried them all and NONE of them provide proper power to external tools that need it. Plus they frequently get hotter than a firecracker. In summation, Apple needs to start giving consideration to the Customer's needs and not just to some fancy ""updated"" technology. Bluetooth does not work dependably and is a real pain most of the time and is not available for all external tools. We NEED physical ports. Please put them back on the MacBooks, especially the ""Aires"". And stop taking them off of the Mac Cubes. The last one I bought had no audio port causing extreme problems with my video production work. PLEASE APPLE, BRING BACK THE PORTS. Otherwise I may be forced, God forbid, to go back to Microsoft computers.",2697263090,18545
"This was the first Apple Laptop I've purchased. My entire life I was so excited to always purchase an Apple MacBook/MacBook Air because of the positive reviews. I tend to review most everything in the most positive light, but this is just horrible. I constantly come back to the laptop and it says ""Please report unexpected shutdown to Apple."" This has happened at least 8 times with no response from an Apple Technician. Then the camera quality for a 2020 Machine is something out of the 1990s. It's horrible, I look grainy and I bought this laptop for an MBA program. If you want to run many programs at once, even with upgrade RAM and Processor, you will hear what sounds like an airplane trying to take off CONSTANTLY. The. fan. does. not. shut. off. Sure it's portable, sure the ""build"" quality feels good in the hand. In terms of performance, spend the extra money and don't get this. I'm quite embarrassed I shelled out over $1k for this. Do as you wish, but this laptop is not worth the money and has pretty much ruined my desire to get any form of an Apple Laptop again.",2697262579,18545
"I gave my wife this new MacBook Air as a gift 3 months ago. She is very careful with it. She opens it last night and the screen is garbled. There's a hairline crack in it leading from the left edge. It wasn't dropped. It wasn't pressed on, sat on, or kept under books. In other words it was NORMAL use when the damn thing stopped working.We took it to Apple store and they want $400+ to fix it. It's 3 months old! The guy says the display is flimsy and subject to crack. I go online to see if he is telling the truth... found a LOT of hits of others complaining about how easily the screen cracks.I'm a big Apple fan but am disappointed and outraged that Apple would sell a product with such a design flaw and expect users to ""buy Apple Care"" so that they pay ""less when it breaks""... even under NORMAL use.Save your money, buy and older model or get an iPad which ironically can take a beating by a 12 year old gamer without fail!",2697261930,18545
"I am one of the thousands that have come back to their laptop the next day only to find black vertical lines.  This has happened twice (I bought the computer in August 2021) .  Apple fixed the screen the first time, but are now asking for 514 dollars, claiming that I damanged the screen.  I did not!  This problem is so common there are two class action lawsuits that have been filed against Apple.  They purposely sold a computer that they knew would develop cracks with opening or closing it.",2697261139,18545
First off I’m giving this one star just so you’ll read this honest review. I brought this Mac book and have been satisfied with functionality and speed but I’m giving 1 star because apple really nickel and dimes us as customers. The usb c cable that comes with the laptop is not even close to being one of the best on the market. I attempted to use it to power my elgato game capture card and the card would not read. Kept saying I need a usb3.0 to work. So I then used the cable that came with my Samsung external hard drive and bang it work immediately. I spent a lot of money on this laptop just to receive a weak cable with it. The cable is literally only good for charging and light duty file transfer which I guess is ok for most people. But for me it was not. Apple already doesn’t give us headphones anymore and they don’t even have the decency to give us a very good cable. 1star because for this price I could have built a computer or brought a prebuilt one. Last apple laptop I will ever buy. O and the camera sucks and there are no setting to adjust it.,2697261055,18545
"Just bought the new M1 and through a series of events and customer support prompts: I started out with 2 computer's and can now barely use my old one because it's too old to support macOS Catalina  (mac pro late 2012)...super unhappy, not because the support wasn't excellent, because it was. Rather because I was sent a computer that didn't know how to migrate data from one mac to the next, which is fully unacceptable. Every prompt to fix this issue adds more time I've had to invest in this problem and ultimately makes things worse. I've been at fixing this issue since Tuesday. It would be fine if the process hadn't bricked my old computer where, once I was running logic, can now barely open a pdf. I've been thinking of moving out of the mac eco system for some time now and this will certainly push me on my way out of it. I've not had the new M1 computer for a week and haven't even seen the home screen yet. Every one says how awesome the M1 is, hopefully some day i'll know.",2697260743,18545
"Great out of the box, then slowly the battery life started decreasing, the constant hard reboots to get Safari back up and running, inexplicably running hot, and crashing more often than a Windows machine. Simply plugging in the power adapter is enough to crash the system followed by the necessary reboot.I firmly believe that Apple will eventually get the bugs will get worked out, but for now look elsewhere or wait for either the M1x or M2 processors that will hopefully have this operating smoothly.UPDATE: There are other emerging issues.In Safari, the keystrokes to italicize ""Command+I"" will randomly switch to opening up a new email message, and the keystrokes to convert text to LaTeX, ""command+shift+L"" now inexplicably opens the left panel. I am also coming into the known compatibility issue mentioned elsewhere.",2697260699,18545
"What happens when you perfect a product? You can only go downhill. In 2015 Apple perfected the MacBook. Then, they ruined it.Everyone in 2015: It's great. A bit more battery life would be nice.Apple: We'll make it thinner, make the touchpad so big people hit it with their palms, remove the magnetic break-a-way power cable that everyone loves, replace all the ports with USB-C ports so people have to buy dongles, swap the keyboard for one that barely even functions, and hell (just to mess with everyone) let's lower the battery life.The 2020 does little to fix any of the issues. It's a crap product, but after Jobs died Tim Cook couldn't make changes because he'd basically be admitting he was wrong. And they need to keep changing things because otherwise it is only perfect and not ""new"" - Whoever decided this was the way to go should be working in an Amazon warehouse sorting returns.",2697259781,18545
"My 2018 MBA died (logic board).  It was 2-1/2 years old.  Apple quoted $500 to repair it.  The repair came with a 90 day warranty.  They told me that if I had purchased Apple Care, it would have been covered.  If I had purchased Apple Care on all of the Apple computers I've purchased over the past 25 years I could have bought 2-3 brand new MacBook Airs.  Used to be a fan of Apple.",2697259681,18545
"Good speed, but have several issues with printer both Scan & print. Also I am facing issue with external drive back up.  There is no inbuilt flash drive port.",2697259043,18545
"Don't let the fanboys sway you, you're a beta tester with this laptop.  Lots of software doesn't function with it, I know, it didn't run of key programs I needed, also what does can be buggy at times.  If you're using this for work or real money is counting on its use DO NOT buy, simple as that.  Lots of things should have been better, the bezel in 2021 is thick.  The lack of ports is ridiculous.  If you planned to use windows, count that out.  If your a grandma using it to surf the web go for it.",2697255944,18545
"I've had mine less than 3 months and am unhappy and peeved off. While this is a pretty and nice laptop as well as light and easy to travel with. It LAGS and is SLOW. Every time I haven't opened my laptop an hour after I last opened it nothing happens with the screen and I am forced to hold the power button until it turns off and then on again, if I'm lucky it works the first time. and when you plug anything into it the computer FREEZES! (you also need to get an adapter because it doesn't take USB) Apple is once again charging way too much for a subpar product. If you're looking for fast and streamlined this is NOT the computer for you. Very disappointed and utterly annoyed.",2697255490,18545
"Like thousands of other people, the screen started flickering after about 2 months. Then it went completly black. Apple store said my only option was pay over $400 to fix the screen. Apple call center said they can only take a complaint and my only option is to pay the money the store said to fix their defective product. Google to find out more. Don't by this defective product, Apple says it is not covered by its warranty because it is the customer fault. But, it is happening to 1000s of people and they know it is actually their fault.",2697255465,18545
"Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon",2697255271,18545
"This is one of the most expesive laptops and have not Microsoft pack.  Pages &numbers, is horrible to work in it.You need to buy the New Microsoft pack becasue it does not includying it and worse do not let dowlond due the M1 card, I do not find nothing good different neither in the camera with this new macbook air 2020.  At the least my last macbook air had inclided the Microsoft pack and was more easy to work.  The screen is not different neither with my old macbook, so I am vert disssapoinment, I bougth in January 2021 directly from the Apple website.",2697253088,18545
Bought one directly from Apple. I was excited to see how nice it would be to use since I had recently moved over to using an iPhone and was impressed at how it had improved over the years. All the positive reviews and videos everywhere made this seem like a great product. Don’t be fooled. Please. This is one of the most disappointing and frustrating pieces of tech I’ve ever had the displeasure of getting to use. Never have I seen or used a computer that had so many options that you will never need. Missing options you should always have. And not be capable of preforming basic tasks without bugging out. To those saying this is one of the best computers you’ve ever used… have you ever used a computer before? Anytime within the last 10-15 years? I’m willing to bet not.,2697252370,18545
"It's 2021 and Apple is STILL ripping it's customers off by only including 8 GB's of RAM as the standard configuration.  Even worse is they rip you off again if you purchase this item with 16 GB's of RAM, which is what it should have in the first place!  And of course, there's not an option for a user upgrade.  Ridiculous for the price they charge for their laptops!!",2697252033,18545
"Just as I bought a 2nd M1 Macbook Air... The first one, which I'm currently using to make this review, randomly freezes and then automatically reboots itself after seeing a pink screen. Doing a quick search, you can find ARTICLES about this issue that isn't being fixed with software updates. This must be a hardware issue... God I hope they didn't cheap out again.",2697251542,18545
"UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac.",2697251152,18545
I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.,2697250838,18545
"Buyer beware! Like the MacBook Pro pictured here, the screen of the MacBook Air often cracks within a few weeks or months after purchase, entirely without any misuse. The design flaw seems to be the relative inflexibility of the screen's LCD panel.I ordered a MBA, then returned the package unopened after reading relevant articles on 9to5mac and the discussion thread on the Apple support site. With few exceptions, Apple refuses to make the repair under warranty. The user's cost of replacing the screen amounts to half the purchase price.",2697250693,18545
I have big hands. This computer was not made for anyone who has large hands. My hands cramp constant as i type and i cannot get a bigger/better computer because of how much i have already spent. It is extremely frustrating. It is so small. I mistype constantly and have accidentally deleted many important things!!! This computer also glitches ALOT. It is constantly changing my mouse from “single click” to “double” . It constantly opens new tabs and new pages for no reason. Waste of money. Just buy a pc. I am regretful,2697250438,18545
I've tried several wireless mouse and flash drive neither will connect to device.,2697250128,18545
Be aware the screen is extremely delicate and prone to break for no apparent reason. Apple won't acknowledge the design fault and now there is a class action law suite. Stay away from the AIR unless you enjoy expensive repair bills.,2697249659,18545
"Theres a serious glitch where you can't use touch ID if drained from dead battery. Then it will ask you for a password. Unclear if this is an apple ID password or whatever, but mine didn't work. Tried every combo I knew. And then there is no option for reset password. Just none at all. And then it won't enter recovery mode. Just a horrible product, stay far away",2697248748,18545
"Dropped about $2500 on 3 of these roughly 3 years ago.  One had battery issues, one had logic board failure which Apple would not cover, and 3rd is doing fine.  Apple has kept up with design quality, camera is top notch, but does not meet quality expectations overall.  With the reduced cost of Windows machines, may be time to step out of my Apple bubble.",2697247791,18545
Do not buy refurbished/ used laptops from Amazon. Often times they are stolen and when you need software upgraded or fixed the manufacturer will not touch the computer when they figure out its stolen. Amazon will not refund or replace the computer with one that is not stolen. So you are stuck with stolen goods that can not be repaired through the manufacturer,2697247296,18545
"Don't be fulled by 13"" description. Its bigger! And much heavier! New Air completely lost its purpose to be small and light laptop that is convenient on the go.

"Bad Apple! Battery always drop dead without any reason. Sometimes, it is still 90% of battery, but it dropped dead in the middle of nowhere, or freeze, the screen just freezes 10 times a day at least. I have to force it to power off and on 10 times a day at least. I only have the Mac Air for 3+ Years, totally a junk!",2697245216,18545
Why doesn't the warranty option appear anywhere on the page rendering the new MacBook Air (M1) - even if I put it in my cart... there's no checkbox rendering for Apple's warranty?,2697244373,18545
They really should issue a recall on this particular model. The screen cracks on its own and yet Apple denies there is an issue. Going to be exchanging this for an older model that at least will last.,2697243878,18545
I cannot believe how bad this camera is on the so-called sophisticated Apple product? And no USB ports - how ridiculous  is that? So if you want to use an external mouse you can’t do that - I could go on!,2697243781,18545
"If you are planning on using a dock/dongle with this, you might want to wait. Having TONS of issues with USB not working via dock/dongle.

"I've had a variety of Apple equipment in my life-- but also Microsoft Surface, Surface Laptops, Chromebooks, and more. I'm an open minded technology user and tend to go with best of breed or technology that pushes the envelope of what is possible. I like well designed hardware that looks and feels good, and works well.I bought this one open box, that shouldn't matter at all, and it doesn't. It arrived from Amazon Warehouse Deals as ""like new"" condition with ""like new box"" and the unit had no scratches/scrapes on it and was missing 3 months of warranty-- I'm happy to have the remainder.The latest Macbook I had was the 12"" Macbook from several years back. It was quite nice but was too small for me. This one has continued to improve on the screen, battery life and CERTAINLY has improved on the performance front.The unit is thin, svelte, and HEAVY. I mean, it could be a solid block of metal and I would expect the same heft. It's solid. This is not a bad thing for a device that is this thin & small to add some durability to what could otherwise be a very delicate device.The keyboard is very solid with a nice clickety-click, I am not able to tell a difference from this keyboard to the generations that were rather ""controversial"" and I very much do appreciate the touch ID in the power button.Having two USB-C ports is very welcomed compared to my previous which had only one.When looking at the performance of the M1 chip and all previous models, especially the 12"" Macbook, and comparing to the prices those still sell for, it was a no brainer to go with this model. Even compared to the Macbook Pro M1, there is a very slight difference between the two and for a rather light user the cost here was really an incredible value.I love Windows for some things. I have Windows running on this unit as well with Parallels-- easy and simple-- do note you will need to download ARM Windows 10 media for this unit-- I was not able to find a way to migrate my previous VM from Intel based.  It runs very well here and with no issues. Very fast.One thing that didn't work great for me-- maybe it's me-- maybe it's Mac OS-- was plugging it in to a USB-C dock. I have a standard setup at home with 3 monitors, USB based external bose speakers, keyboard, mouse, and typically as I cycle through Chromebooks and Windows devices, I'm able to plug in and fairly easily extend / activate those monitors, use the peripherals and printer/etc. In this case I haven't had success getting this Mac to work with my USB-C based dock and accessories-- to be determined.The screen is beautiful, the hardware is unbelievably solid, the speed is amazing.  I also have a Surface Laptop that I love, but for the Mac variety, this is my perfect equivalent.",2697241353,18545
"I was looking to upgrade from my current dual core intel i7 Windows laptop and tablet. The 2020 MacBook Air M1 screen is sharp, the M1 processor performance is similar to intel i7 quad core for most uses . This laptop is fan-less and gets very warm/hot only when constantly exporting very large 5Gb+ files - otherwise it runs cool to cold. I edit photos on this laptop and my editing software opens much faster and the edits occur very quickly. The 8Gb ram/256 Gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive. The Mac OS memory management allows 8Gb to be more than enough for my projects. The M1 cpu performance and battery life for the MacBook Air M1 easily exceed those of my dual core i7 Windows laptop and tablet. My photo editing software runs faster and is more responsive than on my Windows devices. Also, the MacBook Air M1 performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my Windows devices. This laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the Pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options. I purchased this used base model used at a substantial savings over the list price which made it a fantastic value. I would suggest most users get the 512Gb or larger internal ssd so you won't need an external ssd for video/music storage. I currently use external ssd drives to store my large files so the small 256Gb ssd size in the base model was not an issue. The only possible drawbacks for the MacBook Air are there are only 2 usb-c data/charging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options, (or use older usb accessories), there is no sd card slot, and software apps are still being updated for the M1 cpu. I run Microsoft Office 365 on my MacBook Air. I notice that Office 365 takes a second or two longer to load but once loaded Office 365 runs as fast as it does on Windows.  I don't use this laptop for gaming, video editing, or to connect multiple monitors so I can't comment on those uses. I was not expecting this level of performance from an entry-level device. Don't get caught up in the hype that this base model can replace the MacBook Pro models for heavy work loads or professional use - it doesn't have the heat distribution (fans) to dissipate the heat to prevent thermal throttling under heavy computing or gaming. For most users, just use and enjoy your 2020 MacBook Air M1!!",2697240983,18545
"First time Macbook owner. Really happy with the MacBook Air. Don't let the lack of a fan be off-putting. The only time it gets even remotely warm is when rendering a video in iMovie. Even then, it's by no means hot to the touch. This is probably the most fail proof laptop out right now and dare I say, ever. The lack of a fan eliminates the last mechanical part and means this laptop have no moving parts. The soldered in m.2 storage and committing to your RAM choice for the life of the laptop is my only complaint. So far I'm not finding 8gb of RAM to be an issue. Most of the programs for Mac OS are pretty well optimized for the M1 chip. So Everything feels to work pretty smoothly. The battery life is next level. Over all it's more powerful, cooler and the battery lasts longer than ever. If you have been wanting to get your first MacBook or have been batting around the idea of an upgrade. This would not be a bad choice.",2697240071,18545
"The device is silent because it has no fans, the screen isn't Oled but it looks incredible for watching movies with vibrant colors and is very sharp making it great for text documents with small fonts. The battery life is incredibly good I can constantly get over a day with moderate to high use and yet somehow still manages to be an incredibly light device. It has a good dac and plenty of volume making it a good choice for audio lovers, especially if you use open backs since it makes no noise, and if you don't use headphones the speakers can get very loud and sound really good for a laptop. It runs mac OS which can be hard to adapt too but it is alot less power intensive than windows so you rarely have to worry about overheating or battery in daily use. If you are a professional video or photo editor or run intensive task look towards a pro computer and for everyone else this is a great choice.",2697239792,18545
"This is the bargain deal of the Apple lineup at the moment. The M1 chip gives it crazy power management which equates to ridiculously long battery life, incredibly low temperature operation which needs no fan so also absolute silence. All this while running circles around the competitors offerings which don’t stand a chance of keeping up with this incredible product. With their M1 chip Apple has not just revolutionized the capabilities of a laptop but turned the whole computer industry upside down! And yes it is extremely well made out of a solid chunk of aluminum, is very light and has a world class screen and a redesigned keyboard that feels wonderful. Incase you couldn’t tell I like and recommend this laptop!",2697239725,18545
My first day. I’ve used MacBooks since 2006 when the first Intel processors were used. The M1 chip is amazing. I now understand why 8 Gb of RAM is perfect for this model. Crystal clear text rendering. Silky-smooth touch pad. Nice tactile response on keyboard— big improvement over the troublesome keyboards of the last 7 years. Speakers are lovely. Very pleased. Battery fully charged. Was able to easily migrate from my old 2016 MacBook Retina 12. Easy to connect with iCloud and Mac account. A couple of my non-Apple apps required Rosetta to run with M1 processor—smooth download of Rosetta. Anyone needing a high end camera might go for the MacBook Pro but this is fine for my needs.,2697239295,18545

"I bought my first Mac in 1986 and my first 100 shares of Apple in 1992. No one could have dreamed what Apple was to become. And I never believed that I'd get a job working for Apple, and add to those shares over the next 14 years through the employee stock ownership program. Every 3 months, I get a dividend that's 4 times what I originally paid for those 100 shares, which have now become 6428 shares through reinvesting those dividends.Which brings me to this review: The reason Apple is approaching a 3 trillion dollar market cap is because they make the greatest products in the world, and everyone wants them. And I'm writing this on the laptop in my review, and it's just an unbelievable value!",2697236760,18545
"Arrived quickly packed in harder-than-normal, fitted cardboard box...that was inside another box containing a coat we ordered. (Excellent packing). Waited to unpack it until new cover/screen & keyboard protectors arrived. This is the first Mac I have bought online and the migration looked easy. But it hasn't worked. I've taken down(and since put back up) the firewalls on both new and old laptops, as advised, but  it never did migrate. But signing into everything Apple was easy and I LOVE having finger ID...I'm also looking forward to better battery life and appreciate a slightly larger screen. Great discount. Husband gave me a new iPad in September and I'm anxious to see how I can use that as a secondary screen with MacBook Air.",2697235180,18545
"I needed a fast little laptop, something light, that could work with my Cricut machine, watch streaming shows, research for my book, write my book, play some games on, and not take 20 minutes to load. This does all that, and apparently it has a touch screen! I didn't rate it because I haven't used it! That aside, it's fast, boots right up, runs my Cricut through Bluetooth,  is small and light, and I love it! The only thing is that so much still comes with a regular USB plug and I just had to buy an adapter to go from reg USB to a USB C. Anyway, love it!",2697235038,18545
"I’ve read amazing things about Apple’s new chips but I was still blown away by how well everything worked.  Zero fan noise (possibly zero fan, period), can play all the games I care about (Factorio/FTL/Rimworld/LoL/FFXIV), and everything is snappy as hell. I even bought a Windows Laptop for the same price to compare it to and there was no contest.  Even at $1000 the windows laptop constantly felt cheap, loud, and underpowered.  Needless to say I returned the Windows Laptop and have been enjoying the MacBook Air ever since.",2697234553,18545
"I am nearly 60 and have never had a Mac.  A friend of mine talked me into it, and I love it.  It is not only user friendly but Apple offers ongoing expert customer support for ANY question or tech issue you have.  I am not tech savvy and these people are miracle workers, able even to straighten me out quickly every time I call.  Love the unit and love customer support both.",2697231816,18545
this is my first mac although I have had my iphone for a couple years. This mac was a piece of cake to set up.love it,2697230487,18545
"This laptop si so light and powerful, hard to believe is something like this on the market. With fan free technology you have no noise as well nothing hot anymore under your keyboard.My daughter loves it. Battery is very good si lasting more than 8 hours. She is using it daily at HS and at home. This is a great laptop for the price.",2697228895,18545
I use this for college and it is great! It was really difficult to learn how to use. It is so different from an IPhone. But it loads quick and is beautiful. It picks up finger prints more than your phone does and you can really see them too so make sure to wash your screen but besides that it is amazing! Especially for the price I got it for of $850!,2697228763,18545
"This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I truly love it, and believe it is the best air ever made. No plans to upgrade anytime Sumer. Truly revolutionary in the laptop genre. Cheers Apple!",2697226539,18545
I needed to upgrade my old desk top computer and synch it with my iPhone.  Perfection.  Everything about Apple is the best and this MacBook Air is delightful.  There is so much more I can do and I can see the possibilities are endless.,2697225769,18545
"This is a phenomenal laptop and not just at its price point. The M1 chip is snappy and fast, the battery life is amazing and the screen quality is excellent. All of that is bundled in a thin, light and quiet (fan-less) form factor. I’d highly recommend this MacBook Air unless you want to run high intensity games (they just aren’t native to Mac OS and won’t run as well as they will on Windows).",2697222541,18545
Its cool. Running Zwift just fine after downloading rosetta. I push through an older 780p projector and i have the apple adapter for hdmi (non 4k) …and its crisp enough for me at this point. Opted for the rose gold and it really added a special tone to the notebook. Im happy with it self updating too. The fingerprint button is a big easy too. I think I’ll keep it.,2697221249,18545
"Not much to say here that’s different from what’s been said elsewhere. Build quality on point per usual with Apple. Feels as slick as ever. No problems thus far about app compatibility with the M1 chip. As with almost all apple products, you can purchase with your eyes closed.",2697220654,18545
"I’ve wanted a MacBook for the longest time, and Amazon surprised me having the cheapest option for buying this one! So I finally took the plunge. I’m upgrading from a very tired HP. Never having experience with MacBook before, I’m in love with it. It’s awesome how much you can personalize this little laptop. Lighting fast, too. Getting to know the touch pad and all the little features is mind boggling in the best way.",2697220447,18545
"I love my mac. Works perfectly, very fast and the battery life is sooo long.  I use it every day for more than half the day and I only have to charge it about 1 or twice a week! I really recommend.  The touch ID is awesome too.",2697220200,18545
So I hesitated to buy this computer thinking I wouldn't use it enough to justify the price. I absolutely love it! Granted I just use it to surf and shop but it is so user friendly and the keyboard is awesome! I'm really glad I bought it and I use it every day.,2697219373,18545
This is my first Apple laptop and I LOVE IT.  It is so quick and easy to use.  There is a learning curve but luckily I have my kids.,2697218993,18545
"This is the first Mac I have owned, I'll never go back to pc's!! very fast and super easy to use. it works with all my Apple electronics. I haven't played any games on it yet so I couldn't give it any stars yet, also it has stars for touch screen which this model doesn't have, it has the Touch ID.",2697218932,18545
"My first Mac after years of Linux. I couldn't be more impressed. I'm amazed at what this machine can do with only 8GB RAM. I always have a dozen+ browser tabs, multiple VSCode windows, Xcode, and countless other programs open, and this thing never gets bogged down. I'm a total convert!",2697216671,18545
"Excelente producto, batería alcanza para una jornada de trabajo de oficina promedio.  Calidad del material excelente.  En general es un gran producto y sobre todo que su vida útil es mínimo de unos 5 años.",2697216489,18545
I play the sims all the time on it now. I can also get my work and homework done. This is a great laptop. It costly but it's worth the money.,2697216284,18545
"It’s simple , clean aesthetically, and really powerful compared to older models . The m1 chip has really put this laptop on another level. Easy to carry and can handle simple and even hard tasks .",2697213284,18545
"Apple doesn’t offer touch screen laptops.  Description is missleading as it does describe touch screen capabilities. In actuality it applies to touch screen ID, the little square black button at the top right of the keyboard.  First time apple laptop user.",2697212718,18545
I called Geek Squad and they could not fix the problem.  Unfortunately I had to return the wildly anticipated Macbook Air. So disappointing.,2697212171,18545
"Replaced a previous MacBook Air with the new version. Same sleek design, upgraded performance. The computer is quick and easy to use. Plus it is lighter than the 2011 version I replaced.",2697209606,18545
This has everything I could possibly want in a laptop and more! I love being able to use my fingerprint to access my laptop! It is thin and light for easy portability as well! Definitely recommend!,2697206962,18545
"Been wanting a MacBook for a decade-I love this one! I thought rose gold was discontinued in this model, but mine was rose gold -Love it!",2697206390,18545
"This is my first Mac ever. I had to go through a small learning curve to get used to the OS and the keyboard layout and shortcuts. But now I am so happy with the purchase.Really good screen, trackpad and keyboard. Amazing battery life. So compact and light. The only thing that I miss from my previous laptop is a touchscreen.I would without any hesitation recommend this for anyone looking for a handy and powerful laptop.",2697206277,18545
"This is the first time I have used a Mac product for an extended period of time. I have owned it for a couple months now and must admit I am very happy with how well it performs. My apprehension at buying a Mac product was in getting used to the OS, as it is considerably different from Windows. However it did not take long for me to get used to macOS, it was easy to learn and use, with much better organization than Windows.",2697205766,18545
"I’m in school and this computer is fabulous. I can’t attest to gaming, but it does wonderfully with papers, speed, social media, zoom and webex meetings, and messing around on the cricut.",2697204520,18545
Great laptop! My daughter loves it. Awesome purchase and nicely packaged for care.,2697203228,18545
"Just a heads up- the item is rose gold, not gold.  I'm actually happy that it's rose versus yellow gold.",2697202525,18545
"I purchased this at the beginning of March, and for the past month, I have found out that this has been really efficient for me. I have been able to use this laptop for multiple school purposes and even stream movies and tv shows which has been really nice for me. The battery efficiency is also really nice I must add.",2697201418,18545
"I don't get the hype about M1 chip. Half of my programs aren't compatible with it and some aren't updated anymore so there is a little hope for a fix. The camera is horrible as well, picture quality is worse then what my 3 years old smartphone produces",2697201327,18545
"Got this for my daughter for college, she loves it",2697201240,18545
The computer would start up quickly and battery last a long time. It is a great computer.,2697200146,18545
"Apple notebooks are great and work smoothly, however it is inconceivable that such an expensive and top machine does not support 2 external monitors such as the previous macbookair with intel chip does.On top of that there are only 2 USB C ports, so that any additional connection must come with expensive connectors.",2697199984,18545
"it’s thin not too heavy a nice sleek look is the perfect laptop for school, really fast and overall great quality. my only complaint is the camera terrible quality but i don’t really use the camera overall a 9/10 connects to iphone and u can see ur messages",2697199854,18545
"Calidad, fino y elegante.  Características esperadas de APPLE.",2697199129,18545
"No issues with the MacBook Air, NIB. No scratches, or issues ATT. Took me two days to set it up and become familiar with a MacBook, but that’s just me. So far, so good. Happy with the purchase.",2697198327,18545

"IntroAs a college student, having a reliable and portable workstation is extremely valuable. The New MacBook Air powered by the M1 chip is one of the most exciting devices recently released by Apple. Although it looks just like the previous models, the M1 chip delivers insanely great performance.Design and buildSince its inception, Macbook Air’s design and build were one of its core selling points, and the Macbook Air M1 is no exception. It has that Signature Aluminium body that you’ll see with the other Macbook Variants. The laptop not only looks premium but it definitely feels like your money’s worth. You can easily open this laptop with only one finger, this is possible because of the incredibly engineered hinge design done by apple. One of the things that the original Macbook air lacked for a while was a decent display, gone are the days of a 720p panel. And brought is a beautiful P3 Wide color gamut 2560*1440p panel, The overall viewing experience is awesome! The bezels are the same size as last year's model, which was kinda disappointing when compared to other laptops recently released, but it's not something that will ruin the overall viewing experience. The updated magic keyboard has better travel and also the gigantic mouse pad is always a blessing, I’m yet to find a trackpad on a laptop that I like better than the ones made by apple. The dual speaker grills on this laptop produce pretty decent sound, however, there is some slight distortion at high volumes.StorageStorage is also very important as a college student. As you're going to need some space to store all your documents, files, and Zoom Lectures. The MacBook Air comes with up to 2TB of SSD storage. This specific model I have only had 128GB of storage which honestly should be fine for most students, and if you don’t want to spend a lot of money you can always buy an external SSD or hard drive. This will cost you way less than what Apple offers.PortabilityAs a College student in 2021, because of Covid, it's been kinda different, (Very small pause)all of our classes nowadays are held on zoom or some other online platform. So if you wanna use this laptop outside of a typical campus setting, then portability starts to matter. The MacBook Air weighs in at 2.75 pounds and is 15.6mm thick. This laptop will easily fit in most backups without feeling a noticeable weight difference. This is important to a lot of students, especially if you have back-to-back classes keeping in mind the average textbook weighs just over 4.6 pounds. This Laptop also easily fits in most handbags for women who were wondering.Reliability and BatteryThe Apple MacBook Air has proven itself as one of the most reliable laptops for a student this past decade. The Macbook Air is going to be a more compelling laptop for the students this, because of its insanely reliable performance for its price, but let's talk about the chip that’s made all this possible.The biggest change this year is no doubt the M1 chip, the ARM-based chip is fast,  like stupid fast. Applications open up real quick and the performance is consistently reliable. Not only can it easily fly through day-to-day tasks like browsing the internet and typing research papers, but it can also handle intensive tasks such as 4K video editing, in fact, I managed to edit an entire 4K video on the M1 MacBook air and the performance & exporting times were very impressive. Anyway, that was sometimes impossible on the previous-gens of Macbook air. Now if you are considering this device for video editing then I would highly recommend the 16 Gig variant.The next best thing aside from its insane performance is the incredible battery life, I think this is the best battery life I have ever seen on a laptop of this form factor. The laptop lasted me multiple days of light usage with the usual workload being typing, browsing, and streaming content. I can pull a full day of heavy usage with tasks like editing photos and videos.ConclusionOverall there’s a quote that says, “Speed is irrelevant if you are going in the wrong direction”. (Mahatma Gandhi). The Macbook Air M1 has set a new benchmark for consistent performance and delivers insanely awesome battery life which makes the overall experience pretty fire. Its Portability, reliability, and speed not only make this a great investment for a student but also for anybody who’s always on the go, and I’m personally really excited for the direction that Apple is heading towards with their new M lineup of processers.",2697181037,18545
"No problems with the mac air. Easy to transition from my old 2104 MacBook Pro. I also bought an external HD which was cheaper than upgrading from old 256 to 512. My warning is about Office 2019. There was stuff on the web that 2016 would not work, needed 64bit, but while there seemed to be workarounds, I just upgraded and bought 2019. There is a scam site posing as Microsoft Office/setup that looks legit once on it, but you get an error message and phone number to resolve. After half an hour he explains that it is the firewall and can fix it by downloading one costing only hundreds of dollars. The url isn't Microsoft but rest looks like it. While I didn't fall for it, it is preying on the few who might. So thought I would mention it. The mac is good and worth upgrading especially if, as with mine, hardware faults are developing in old one.",2697180276,18545
I JUST GOT IT TODAY I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION ORDERING IT HERE. I HAVE NO ISSUE BOUT IT AT ALL I GAVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE THERE IS A TINY DENT NOT A BIG DEAL.,2697180048,18545
i love it! i’ve had it for about 2 weeks now and it’s the best laptop i’ve ever owned. i do play games on it (mainly sims) and it doesn’t lag or mess up which i’m happy with. great buy and i’m happy i bought it!,2697178873,18545
"Great product, fast and durable. Exactly what I expected.",2697178593,18545
"For the price, this recent M1Air is on a different planet regarding performance.  More ports would be nice, but it's a MacBook Air.",2697178399,18545
I really liked this laptop - it has all I needed! Really appreciate the really good packaging and on-time arrival. It is also working very fast.,2697177958,18545
Still learning some of the new features. Not sure if I like it better than the MacBook Pro. It is slow to come on at times and sometimes has to be fiddled with to get it to come on. Screen quality is good and speed is improved. Touch sensitive keys are taking some getting used to.,2697176256,18545
Hey it’s an Apple product so it’s made well and is quality!,2697176212,18545
"I'm new to the Mac world, at least since the early days in the 80s. So far it has been a pleasant experience and I like the stock software and layout. I haven't really had to purchase any additional apps to be able to do the things that I've become accustomed to on PCs, so there is a nice learning curve. I do have a couple of constructive criticisms, that are not specific to the MacBook Air, though. In the future, I'd like to see touchscreens included on their laptop models (being a former teacher of persons with autism, they really benefit from the additional input method). Also, the Retina display is awesome, but maybe in some of their higher priced laptops like the MacBook Pro they can start using OLEDs as model upgrades. Other than that I'm a fully satisfied Mac devotee now (though I still love my PCs)!",2697175257,18545
"The return policy at Amazon is even better than the one at the Apple store, the price is better too.Machine is much lighter than MacBook Pro but just as good at a better price point. A great introduction to the world of Mac laptops.",2697175060,18545
The first one I received got bricked trying to restore after the initial setup failed.The second one is fine.You can google the issues.Apple support said I'd need to bring the first one into the apple store for a firmware update to get it working.Not great for a brand new 1000$ laptop.Anyway the second one came already updated and everything has been fine so I'm happy now.It's snappy and has that new macbook smell.,2697174743,18545
Really nice upgrade. Long battery life and completely silent. It also of course integrates with iPhone extremely well.,2697174226,18545
So far - I like everything about this laptop.,2697173685,18545
It’s just overpriced for what it is. An equivalent windows computer is $400 cheaper with the same specs and functionality.,2697173033,18545
"I have purchased at amazon many times, I am satisfied with all products, about this macbbok air m1 works very well and the price is very good, I think I should hurry to own it, this can also be a gift.",2697172204,18545
"First new computer since 2011. Replaced an old iMac with this. Blazing fast, bright graphics, responds well, well built. And a fantastic value. With 256G of storage, it cost the same as the new Apple Watch Ultra.",2697171372,18545
"When has an apple product ever done anyone wrong. They are known for their reputation, and this is no exception. Obviously reliable, great battery life, stunning pixelation, and works well for remote working.",2697170852,18545

Great deal on this and works phenomenally,2697170219,18545
"Very sleek and the color is beautiful. I like the processor in the laptop and rarely have any issues. Sometimes the screen will get stuck if I click on something with a right click and I have to restart the computer to fix the issue, but this is on a very rare occasion. They keys are flat and spaced far apart enough that I can type quickly and hit the right key *almost* every time.",2697169976,18545
This is just the update I needed for school and my graphic/marketing job. Lightweight and perfect to travel with.,2697167801,18545
"It's just amazing !! this one with the m1 chip is a game changing , but i highly recommend to get the extra storage and the 16 gb ram i mean am not saying that the 8 gb ram won't work but i highly recommend to get the 16 gb ram if you're looking to run multiple tasks on this MacBook or playing games from steam .",2697167790,18545
Thank you,2697167781,18545
"an excellent option, for work, have some problem with docker!! (for developers guys) the rest all very well, the screen, and the sound, and options are good, we only recommend a base for MacBook, for some heat in the down of the laptop, but I think is because don't have Forced ventilation for the Processor.",2697166911,18545

Changed from my MBP2017 to this one. Portable with strong functions.,2697164073,18545
I would buy it again. I’ve been a PC owner all my life and thus is my first Mac. I think I will stick with it.Update:  after trying this Mac for a year I gave up. As a lifelong Microsoft user I just could not make the switch and I bought an inexpensive PC which I use a lot more than I ever used the Mac.  The biggest hurdles were the hot buttons and incompatibility of spreadsheet and word documents. Nobody else seemed to be able to open them. The only way was to export to Excel or Word before sending them out and this resulted in a lot of versions of the same documents. Also the file manager was too hard to get used to send did not easily manage photos. I’m not changing the rating because lifelong Mac users would probably have the same problem in reverse.,2697162450,18545
It’s a really good laptop really happy with it,2697161931,18545
Everything I need for a great price in a apple laptop,2697161490,18545
Good buy,2697161457,18545
"This laptop is very good for students and people wanting to do basic work as well as people who are going to have this laptop under EXTREME loads. I've ran heavy games and video editors and its done amazing! it's even beat some of my other $8,000 MacBooks! It's very light weight ( 2.8 pounds ) and is very thin but yet durable. It doesn't feel cheap like some laptops at this price point, It feels very premium with the metal body and soft keys and the retina display. The track pad is VERY large for the size of this laptop. I also love how it's fan-less so it never makes any noise which is another reason why it's good for students. ( video calls, etc. ) My one and only complaint is the camera quality. It looks nice if you have good lighting but if you're in bad lighting it looks like a potato filming. But if you can get passed that it's great. I also love how the keyboard is backlit, it helps a lot if you're in a dark environment. The screen is also very good, it's nice and bright and has amazing colors which is very good for photo editing! The package even came several days early and shipped very fast! Although the costumer service isn't very good. they didn't answer the questions I messages them about. ( I'll try to answer some questions I had ) It does come sealed in the original Apple packaging and it does have the M1 chip. All around I highly recommend this. It's amazing for the price tag.",2697161363,18545

"Nice , fast and lightweight",2697157241,18545
I expected more speed from it.,2697157033,18545
Price point for an apple laptop good. Screen is great so are the speakers. Dead easy to set up. I had my last one for 13 years hope this is the same. Only negative. The new usb-c ( lightning ) does not support the apple super drive. You have to buy an adapter.,2697156323,18545
"It’s a total beast. Performance, battery all seems amazing.",2697156014,18545
"I was hasitating to buy used, but it was like new. No scratch, no dent, even battery charging cycle was 2. Came with box, original charger, USB-C cable. I am happy with it.",2697155936,18545
"This is the best laptop I have ever used. I got this product a week ago and works amazing. Highly flexible, stylish, long battery life, and better screen quality. I personally highly recommend this product. Thank you Apple products for making my life easy.",2697154326,18545

"Pros: Battery life : 5 stars, this machine last all day and I don't even know howScreen: 2560x1600 in a 13 inch screen is remarkableLook: It's apple so I got nothing to complainSound: You can hear this from your bathroom with curtain and door closedHEAT: DOES NOT HAVE ANY FAN SOUND AND HEAT PROBLEM AT ALL. THIS THING IS QUIET !!!Keyboard: No more butterfly keyboard!Cons: Apple got the same deal for student but they attach FREE airpod so sadly I have to return this to amazon so I can that dealSmuge spot due to fingerprint or sweat on keyboard is unavoidable and very annoying to look at but I guess it is what it is.All in all, I highly recommend this to any college student especially comp sci major to buy this. I was always a window users except for my Iphone and I also have a fair share of laptop from gaming to everyday but this M1 laptop right here beat everything else at this price point.",2697151545,18545
Using this for personal use.  Still learning how to use.  Long battery life,2697149576,18545
just a best laptop,2697149318,18545
"First let's start with the overall look of the MacBook Air, it's thin, sleek and super light.  I got the gold color one and it took me a while to decide between the silver & gold. But after receiving my gold Mac, I'm so happy I went with it. The color looks so much BETTER in person, it seems to have more of a rose gold color in person but if you take a picture of it, it looks gold.I use my Mac for some web searching, emails ( when I do so the battery does good) and if I'm doing some photo editing and downloads it dies faster. I spent all day on it and it does not get hot, so that's a plus. I don't feel like I have to give it a break.I got the standard memory and just got a hard drive to upload my photos on there ( if needed)Now the camera! it's terrible LOL but that doesn't bother me much because I won't be using or doing any zoom calls. But i wish apple would make it better since it's not a cheap lap top.I also came from not having a lap top, So far is perfect for me and what I use it for. I love that apple connects everything for you and it makes it that much easier to see emails, txt , calendar etc......I also love the vibrant color and sharpest of the screen.",2697145975,18545
Love my new laptop. I use it every day for work and it’s great!! Zero complaints.,2697142479,18545

"I was able to get this Mac for around $800 in Nov. 2022. It arrived quickly and very well packed for shipping. I'm really enjoying it overall up to this point. It's definitely not a super powerful machine but for just normal everyday use it seems to be a very solid choice. Coming from a mid 2013 MacBook air its quite literally a night and day difference. Snappy response, amazing display in a very sleek form factor. If I had to complain about something, I would note that the keyboard has an extremely small travel making it a bit odd using experience at first but it's something you quickly overcome with just a couple hours of usage. Then, what I would consider the biggest downside is the lack of ports. A total of 2 USB-C ports and a headphone jack is all you get. Luckily there are countless USB-C hubs available for a decent price. I spent around $80 and got one that not only has all ports I could possibly need but also allows for a 2-monitor output. I would say for the price it's really hard to find much I don't like about it. When looking into a new Mac I was originally looking into the M2 Air but after reading up on them I heard a lot of complaints regarding overheating as well as slower overall peak speeds due to it using 1 single 8GB RAM stick opposed to the M1 using 2 4GB sticks allowing for the system to run more smoothly. When buying a base model, you're already going into it with a relatively small hard drive and low total RAM so when given the option I found it just made more sense to go with the M1 at the time of purchase. That decision was solidified when the M1 went on sale making it a nearly $500 price difference between the two models. To summarize, if you're looking for a reliable MacBook at a ""cheap"" price to have as an everyday mess around machine I 100% would say this is the one. It's nothing super powerful but it's far from sluggish. Great for normal use, streaming, browsing and minor editing etc. I have yet to find a situation in my regular use it couldn't handle, so for me it's exactly what I needed.",2697140476,18545
"My daughter is a budding photographer and got this computer to edit her photos and for college. She loves everything about it, it fits her needs perfectly.",2697140446,18545
"It's a good computer by all standards. It's pricey but you get what you pay for. Great screen and its fast. Just wish....like all electronics, that the battery lasted longer.",2697138078,18545
"Really like this laptop bought this as a gift for my wife to do her Masters and she loves it, very easy to use, super fast, screen quality is exceptional, Keyboard feels lovely and very affordable the M1 chip really made a difference only one thing if you can afford it try to bump up to the 512GB will worth it.",2697138013,18545

Absolutely Amazing Laptop! Best Laptop On The Market With New M1 Chip From Apple!! And This Coming From A Windows Users! Love This Computer 💯,2697131788,18545
Loved this computer. It has an Apple processor and I needed to split my drive for windows OS so I’ve returned it and got the one with an intel processor.,2697130370,18545
Was for my son for college and it was perfect.,2697128693,18545

"A typical Apple product, quality product. Love it.",2697126973,18545
Me encanta,2697122890,18545
Overall nice quality,2697122038,18545
Love it,2697121169,18545
"After years of using nothing but PC laptops, the M1 chip compelled me to try Macs. And let me tell you, the hype is justified. The new silicon MacBooks are simply incredible. The ARM-based silicon chip is so amazing that I was able to forgive the laptop for its downsides, which are the 720p webcam, lack of SD card slot, and not being able to upgrade RAM or SSD. Despite these drawbacks, the battery life is insane and the machine is completely silent because no fan is needed since the laptop is so heat-efficient. You're also getting a powerful laptop that outperforms the vast majority of Windows laptops in the market. To top it off, you get a touchpad that puts other laptops to shame, a beautiful aluminum design, and build quality that will last. Well done Apple.",2697120594,18545
"Love the keyboard and Touch ID feature, glad I waited this long to upgrade",2697119621,18545
"I had a bit of trouble adapting, found a decent online site to actually tell me how to use it as it’s way different than my old computer.",2697119132,18545
it works perfectly! I absolutely love it! I've wanted one for years and it def lived up to the hype!,2697118988,18545
I love the battery life. It lasts so long that I charge it sparingly. I love the instant on feature when I lift the lid. I am impressed with the biometric scanner that allows me to log in without my password. The MacBook Air allows me to log in with my Apple Watch as well. The speed is fantastic. I am thoroughly impressed. I have an M1 Mac mini as well. I am hooked.,2697118573,18545
For $800 this was certainly worth a punt - Macs are generally more expensive than equivalent Windows laptops but this is a light machine worth its salt.,2697117120,18545
"It’s a great computer;  is stupidly fast,  the battery last for 15 to 20 hrs on constant use.  If you don’t use it that much last for days without recharge.  It behaves like a smartphone but just bigger to fit a full keyboard and a big screen, with the same or better performance.  This is the new era of laptops and desktops, you’ll see soon other brands doing it too.  Because it uses “NO FAN AT ALL”, is very thin and lightweight.  I don’t need to use an egg carton on my lap to avoid overheating like the fan ones. The M1 ship is definitely a great upgrade.  Excellent idea!!!",2697115710,18545
Insane battery life. Fast and NO noise. M1 chip. Best laptop I've owned.,2697115219,18545
Everything right on,2697115086,18545
"The audio coming from the small speakers is incredible, I haven't needed my external speakers. The display is an upgrade from average. Convenience with the long battery life and a sleep mode that actually works flawlessly. Had an issue with a crossword app heating up the unit but other than that the first two days the verdict is thumbs up.",2697114926,18545

"I use this to teach online. Overall extremely satisfied. Fast, reliable and looks nice. The only two things I’m not crazy about are A) the camera isn’t really HD and B) I ordered gold and it looks more like a rose gold color.",2697112059,18545
so beautiful made. fast delivery.  It is like a new toy for me.,2697111936,18545
very god. thanks,2697110834,18545
"I was worried about the compatibility of the M1 processor but by now i can tell that at the moment all My stuff is running flawless on this Mac: all Office programs, FTP clients, compressors, vpn software, database clients, etc. Even games like CS in Steam.",2697110749,18545
It's a Macbook. Slick design lightweight. Never had any issues with any of my Macbooks. The M1 chip is nice.,2697108572,18545
"I am coming from a PC laptop, and I have to say, I am more and more impressed with this mac air every day. Which is probably because I am learning something new every day. The screen has good brightness and color. It is super fast on opening and using apps. It is lightweight, smaller than my last one, so I can see this will be easier to travel with.",2697108378,18545
Apple products never let me disappointed,2697108288,18545
"I needed a new computer and I'm so glad I purchased this one. Holds a charge well, lightweight, and awesome speeds. I love this device and everything it allows me to do from emails to playing games! I wouldn't trade this for any other computer!",2697106376,18545
"I love everything Apple did to update the Air. It’s, by far, the best laptop you can buy right now. That’s especially true if you were a Mac user before. I wasn’t, so I had to learn where everything was and what not, but it didn’t take to long.The battery life is PHENOMENAL and I have had 0 issues with the thermals. When Apple said it would cool passively, they weren’t lying. I’ve had 8-9 programs running simultaneously and it was obviously warmer, but nothing compared to any other laptop I’ve used. The fact that it’s dead silent when running is a nice perk as well.I like how they kept a lot of the tried and true design on the outside because I don’t think many people saw anything wrong with it to begin with.The screen has amazing clarity and, in true Apple fashion, all of my Apple devices connect seamlessly.Absolutely the best laptop one can buy right now.",2697104612,18545
Bought this laptop for my son for Christmas. He has a gaming PC but this laptop has completely blown him away. The screen is exceptional and the performance is phenomenal he says. Made for a perfect gift,2697104380,18545
Purchased for college,2697100518,18545
I have just started to use it but right out of the box it is running fine. It is my first Mac and I am impressed. The packaging is outstanding! Give me a couple of months and I’ll give a complete full review.,2697100246,18545
"I was shocked at how great of a computer this is. It is quick, and the battery life is fantastic. I was skeptical of Apple moving away from Intel, but they knocked it out of the park.",2697100221,18545
"Bought this for daughter as all other devices were triggering her migraines. She has been able to use this with no issues. It connects to her iphone and iPad. It’s very thin and lightweight and the battery has a long life. I was skeptical at first because I could get a regular laptop at Walmart for much cheaper,But this has been worth the money. I expect her to be using in severalYears.",2697099773,18545
Granddaughter is using for school.,2697097629,18545
Battery life is great,2697097226,18545
"Bought this product on sale for during Black Friday.  Great product - Apple brand.  Easy to setup and use.  Use for streaming videos, Excel and web browsing.  While this is the base model - I might recommend getting one with 16gb RAM.  When I look at the activity monitor sometimes the memory is in the yellow range when there are too many apps open.  I usually shut down a few and it turns green again.",2697096835,18545
Zoom calls perfect and beautiful. Video quality is excellent.  Performance is amazing.  Running Parallels and Windows 11 preview. Screen looks beautiful.  Movies look amazing.  Audio is loud and sounds spacial.  Battery lasts easily all day and sometimes two days.Blows away my 2015 MacBook Air.  Blows away my 2016 MacBook Pro.  Don't miss the Touch Bar.Ports are enough.  But wish there was one on each side.As perfect a laptop I have owned.And this M1 MacBook air run Windows 11! I use Parallels and Windows runs super fast and looks amazing.  No impacts to battery life.  I saw some reviewers say it won’t run Windows and this is not true.,2697093788,18545
"Perfect computer for college stuff, but not good for gaming.",2697092328,18545
Graphic designer. Great laptop.,2697091760,18545
"Overall: Highly recommended! The M1 MacBook Air really brings the quality for speedy and responsive user experience, great build quality and excellent audio! The air is incredibly quiet and the battery life is stellar! This is really the one to buy for this generation (M1) for cost and productivity. You still need a good USB hub to get more connections but this leaves the unit highly portable, it's a reasonable trade-off. For now we have not noted any memory system issues and we got the 512 GB hard drive model so that there would be more read-write space (a bigger hard drive makes a difference).",2697090784,18545
"This thing is fast -- like 5 times faster than its physically identical Intel predecessor. So fast that it divides users into two ages of computing: pre-M1 and post-M1. 8GB of RAM in M1-land goes a lot, lot, further.Secure your seat in the post-M1 era with this $800 entry-ticket (and sell all your pre-M1 junk), because this 2020 model is fully modern, mostly holding up to the M2.",2697090017,18545
"Back in 2012 I got a MacBook Air with 8GB i7 and a turbo... back in the day it was the most equipped... I believe it was slightly faster in the kickstart by 2 or 3 seconds... yet back then I also paid about 1700 usd, my video card broke at some point back then and I was a bit upset that my only option was to replace the whole mother board, so I kept it broken and fixed it a couple of years later about about 320 usd and it worked decently for an extra couple of years for basic work...I then got an ASUS with 16GB plus 2GB just for video as I wanted it for video editing, but it has 2TB + 256 SSD so the computer is massive and heavy and it has a cheap unresponsive trackpad making it so inconvenient to travel or work at a coffeeshop. SO eventually I am back with Mac for editing my website, answering emails, and all the other trials and tribulations of work... It is so refreshing and made me realize how much I missed this system as well.",2697088244,18545
"I could never go back to using a PC.  My only complaint is that he screen is more easily smudged than my old Macbook.  I love this little machine.  It is light, and just the right size.  The battery stays charged a long time.  I regard this as a really good purchase.",2697087181,18545
"I was really hesitant on making this big purchase through amazon, but this store came through. My laptop came in great condition with no marks or damage done during packaging and shipping. It came in the right color and everything. It works like a charm.",2697086221,18545
replaced the 1st one on day 4 and 2nd one dead after 9 month of very light use.  Fkin apple,2697085257,18545
"I think all products from Apple are good. So, I use many electronics from that company.",2697084127,18545
"I love my MacBook!! But it was delivered by a over packed uhaul and left in its side out side without knocking to let me know it was there,?to sign for it, not any safeguards in place. I am grateful for the thoughtful packing on your part because it was shipped in an oversized box and no extra packing, it moved freely within the box.",2697082590,18545
 so glad I bought this. I wish it were touchscreen but it works just fine and it came quickly,2697081255,18545
Love love love this MacBook just as described I order two of them one for me and my grand baby  apple is all I know....thank you so much,2697081163,18545

It is my first mac but I like it very well.,2697078086,18545
"I ordered the space gray version and it's beautiful! I've owned an older version of Macbook Air and this one is def faster. Not really sure if M1 has something to do with it or maybe because it's fairly new lol Whether or not it's fast, I'm still keeping it. If I kept the old one for 4 years, this version will be just fine. I'm sure it's faster and better altogether.",2697077722,18545
We expected a NIB laptop but the Apple Security Seals were nowhere to be seen.  Who wants to spend so much and get a used item?  So we returned it and will likely be paying more for this at the Apple Store to ensure we get what we pay for.,2697074388,18545
"excelente calidad, rápido y lo recomendaría 100%",2697074227,18545

"If you are invested in the Mac world, you know these products just work. You don't get the spinning beachball of doom. Turn it on and voila, it does what you require of it.They are fully integrated with iPads and iPhones so that when you edit a document on one device, the newly edited document is what appears on whatever other Apple device you own.They are rock solid, beautiful, durable computers with long lasting battery and, with the new M1 chip, fast.",2697070316,18545
I like it,2697069427,18545
I decided to treat myself this year to this. Ordered it on the Apple website and was told 1-2 weeks. I ordered it on Amazon and it was here in 2 days for the same price! Love this! As for the product ... you can not go wrong with Apple. I was a little shook by the price but its worth every penny.,2697067527,18545
It's no longer necessary to spend a fortune on a laptop for college. This model has more than enough bang for the buck and the kids want Apple laptops.  I assume it will perform better than the Lenovos I purchased (2 out of 3 failed in less than 2 years),2697067294,18545
I love it so much came in the original box brand new no scratches,2697066196,18545
"I bought this laptop in December 2020. I was actually debating myself between this one or a similar Windows computer, I almost went for the Windows because the processor of the MacBook Air 2019 wasn't good enough (intel core i3), but I decided to wait and two weeks later this one was launched. It's way superior than any intel core processor, I just love it. I have been using it for almost two years now and it's as good as new. The other features are just what you expect them to be: super light, portable, hi-res screen. Would buy again.",2697066019,18545
What i was expecting,2697065162,18545
"I've owed two HP Laptops (yikes) and a few Macintosh Laptops (decent) over the years but this one is the best so far.  This MacBook Air M1 is just wonderful.  There are many great features but a few that standout are: Instant on when you open the lid; Long lasting battery; Incredible sound.When I first heard the sound, I was stunned.  I thought for a moment it was coming from a large sound system.  It has been engineered to sound clear and spatial.",2697064808,18545

"An apple product that doesn't break the bank but performs well. Got this gift for the girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. Screen is amazing with vivid colors. The battery life is pretty closed to advertised, lasts the whole day without fail. It also runs adobe programs pretty smoothly so that's a plus for working professionals. Would recommend to anyone needing a portable travel buddy that can put out work too",2697060320,18545
I purchased this as I see this was the almost 'perfect laptop' for everyday task and its a big yes!Its all about the new M1 chip that speeds up and gives a great battery life. Performance is so good that I recommend this.,2697059517,18545
"This is a great desktop. I have it paired with a Dell hi res display I purchased with my old Mac. My old Mac was getting unreliable (2015). This air is very similar to the Mac but faster, reliable. I like the larger touch pad and don't have to use a wireless mouse. I have a USB type C HUB to get more connectivity. Keyboard is great.",2697059107,18545

"I was very skeptical to buy a MacBook on Amazon due to some bad reviews, but I went ahead due to the low price and trust me, it is the best decision. The laptop is brand new and genuine.

"Picked up this model on sale for $799. If you can get it on sale, I'd recommend it even over the new M2 MacBook Air (if you're getting the base model) for those who want a capable machine that can handle day to day tasks and don't need all the bells and whistles of a Pro model.This has actually replaced a Windows machine that I was using for a long time for my daily workflow, and even with only 8 GB of memory compared to 16 on the Windows one, I find that this machine runs much better. It runs right out of the box without needing to spend a couple hours uninstalling bloat that comes standard with almost every Windows laptop that sucks up my RAM and CPU if I don't remove it. The only downside is that the 256 GB of SSD is a bit light, but since I mostly work off the cloud anyway, it's not a deal breaker. If you do need more, I would recommend buying a model with that space built in as you would need to get an external drive otherwise.Pros vs. M2 Air:- SSD is a bit faster (as it's two 128 GB modules running in parallel, while the new one is a single module) which also is a slight boost to longevity.- There is no notch on the display (I personally don't mind it, but if that's a sticking point for you this or the 13"" M2 Pro model would probably serve you better).- Slightly improved cooling system (neither Air model has an active cooling setup, but the integrated heat spreader on the M2 model is a fair bit smaller so it throttles itself a bit sooner), but not major if you don't plan on pushing too hard (and if you are, the M2/M1Pro/M1Max MBP is probably better suited for you anyway).- I find that I like the way the keyboard types a little more on the M1 model over the M2. It's definitely a matter of personal preference, but it feels a bit nicer to type on for me. Might be down to the fact that it uses the traditional wedge shape which gives a little bit of an angle to the keyboard, where the M2 MBA is more like the 2021 MBP shape.Cons vs. M2 Air:- No dedicated MagSafe charging port, meaning that you only get one available USB-C port to use when charging.- Overall system performance is a bit lower than the M2, but not really by a whole lot. If you're not planning on really stressing the system you won't notice.- Function keys are only half height, while the M2 has full height keys. Again, personal preference, but as someone with slightly larger hands who normally uses larger keyboards I prefer the full size keys.- Webcam is only 720p instead of 1080p on the M2. I don't use it that much, but if you do plan to be doing a lot of Zoom, FaceTime, etc. you may want to keep that in mind. It's still not bad, but the quality difference is something that you will notice.- Sound quality is a tad weaker in my opinion, but nothing major, and I usually use my AirPods or some other external speakers/headphones anyway.On the whole, it's still a great MacBook. Sure it's more expensive than plenty of Windows laptops, but the battery performance is solid, and even with only 8 GB of RAM (if you want more, go for a MacBook Pro instead), it's still overall a solid option for light to medium duty workloads due to how optimized the new Apple silicon is. On programs that take full advantage of it, the boost in performance is massive. Even with using Rosetta for older Intel-based programs, it's still quite fast. Compared to any Intel machine that came before it, it blows them out of the park with superior performance and battery life.If you can get it on sale, or a good refurbished one (in that case I recommend going directly to Apple), it's probably one of the best laptops on the market right now. For students and anyone looking for a Mac that's lightweight but capable, this is a solid choice.",2697052485,18545

"This is a brand new 2020 model and something I never thought I could afford any time soon. I’m an author who needs to sync from my iMac desktop to a laptop, iPad and iPhone. Never knowing where I’ll be for research, notes, photos, or character sketches, the ability to move from one to the other makes my work a little easier. If quality on a budget is what you’re looking for, I highly recommend this seller and product.",2697049842,18545
Am new to Mac but so far I like it.,2697049597,18545
"Fast. Battery life never an issue. I wanted the same keys on the keyboard as the pro. Anything else was nothing but perfect! Ohhh and I wanted a whole Touch Bar, not one key for ID.",2697049015,18545
"This is my very first MacBook finally, got it out of necessity for work backup computer and will work great w/easy setup and ability to connect to home wifii. Brand new 2020, no touch screen but impeccable quality for a smaller laptop and unbeatable price!",2697048613,18545
"I am a senior citizen and use my laptop to store files and and transfer photos to thumb drives for storage. I do surf the net for entertainment, but I’m not a gamer. Product arrived in excellent condition and is perfect for my use.",2697048496,18545
Love the computer overall 🥺 thanks Amazon,2697048188,18545
"I hate that this laptop doesn’t have a USB-A port! I can’t sync my iPhone, iPad, anything that uses a USB-A port. It only has two USB-C ports, which doesn’t help me. Very disappointed. I had to buy an adapter but that doesn’t work either. I’m at my wits end!",2697047757,18545
"I've owned my fair share of laptops and let me tell you.. Nothing even comes close to this. Spectacular battery life, incredible display, tactile keyboard and haptic track pad with all its' gestures and features which makes multitasking a wonderful experience. to top it all off, Big Sur (os) wraps it all up and makes your workflow the greatest pleasure. Only thing I would change is the camera. It is decent in a well lit environment but struggles in the dark. Putting a bigger sensor is a hardware limitation and I understand that. Having a display this thin comes with its' sacrifices. If I could give this laptop 10 stars I would. Don't hesitate on purchasing it, you won't regret it.",2697047376,18545
"This is what I'd hoped for w/ the MacBook. Great typing, fast and super media performance. A perfect stay at home compliment to my Pixelbook Go.",2697047349,18545

"I've been using Mac laptops for 30 years (yes before there were Macbooks) and this is my favorite yet.With this Macbook Air I'm coming from an 8 year old MacBook Pro. In comparison, it is:Super light. Feels like carrying a book.Great feeling keyboard.Fast.Excellent battery life.Beautiful display.Overall, I am more productive and happy since I started using this MacBook Air!(When I first got it there were some bugs but perhaps they fixed them in Big Sur. It's been 3 months now, smooth sailing.)CONS:I hate Apple so much for changing the USB port. You need to buy an adapter for any external drives with the standard old USB cord to work. I bought a beautiful cover for my MacBook but they didn't plan for the fact that many people would be plugging in a long adapter so I have to take the shell off. Did I say I hate Apple for doing this?",2697044605,18545
"Such a beautiful laptop! It’s an adjustment going from an Hp to a Mac, but I am loving it!",2697044279,18545

Have been needing a new computer for months. researched this Apple MacBook Air. Read many positive reviews. Was delivered two days ago and am very happy with my purchase!,2697041124,18545
"I absolutely love this 2020 M1 laptop!  No blemishes, scratches or stains.  Super thin and light.  The gold color is stunning.  Has a finger security tab you can login from.  Transferring data from my old computer to this one was a breeze.  I'm experiencing a learning curve with transferring my docs and workbooks from Word and Excel to Pages and Numbers, but it's no diff than switching from Windows to iOS, just takes a bit to figure some things out. I highly recommend this laptop!.",2697040887,18545
"My grandmother’s birthday falls on Christmas Day, so she pretty much gets whatever she wants each year. This year is no different.She decided that she doesn’t like her Windows laptop anymore and wants a Mac. So our family all pitches in and we get her the cheapest new MacBook you can buy.The MacBook Air with this M1 chip is super responsive, intuitive, fast, etc.There’s just one thing, it is completely overkill for her.All she does with it is check email, do her banking, and buy stuff from Amazon.Something tells me my daughter will be using it more than her…I own a MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro and saw no loss in speed when comparing general computer tasks.The MacBook Air is awesome and is perfect for students, business, video editing, design, and so much more, but should not be your first pick for grandmothers.5 stars for Apple fangirl grandmas.",2697039961,18545
