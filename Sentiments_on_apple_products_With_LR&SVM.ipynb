      "Review: i've owned this laptop for a year and a half, and felt compelled to take time out of my frantic day to note that i really think this computer is a giant step backward for the macbook air model and for macintosh as a brand compared to my old 2013 macbook air running yosemite.the lack of a mag-safe connection for the charger is really unforgivable, and this computer has wound up on the floor so frequently that i now have placed the dog bed where the laptop is likely to land.  the keys are beginning to stick.  the screen is beautiful, but gives me a terrible headache.  the memory pressure issue with the m1 is also a real problem in safari, which locks up about every three weeks if you have a lot of windows open-- and it take a long time to force quit safely and recover lost work.  the laptop is also too big-- that extra inch or so of width really makes a difference.  the loss of practical functionality in itunes is really disappointing, imovie and garage band have become much, much harder to use in big sur as well, and apple's insistence on trying to force me into using the kloud is both intensely irritating and very dangerous for my business, where confidentiality is absolutely critical.it is true that the processing speed for offline tasks is impressive-- my music projects do sound much better-- and photo and video editing is great.but the m1's speed is not enough of a reason for me to bond with this computer.  as the months have rolled by, honestly, i've come to kind of hate it.  i'm looking forward to refurbishing my old macbook air, and i'm thinking this may be the last apple product that i buy, even though i can't think of a suitable alternative.i am a 64-year old professional health care provider who has been in it since the early 1980s, and while it's true that i have generally been very unhappy with how gratuitously awful the end-user interface of most tech products have become over the last quarter century, there are some computers that i have actually liked-- my old macbook air was definitely one of them.  this is definitely not.\n",

      "Review: ive owned macs for over 25 years and this is the worst ive ever owned. first off, the mouse buttons are a new horrible design that often do not recognize mouse clicks. clicking this mouse is the worst experience ive ever had on any computer before. my previous 2018 mac was much better in so many ways.also i hate that this new mac only has 2 ports both being usb-c. one is used to charge which means you only have a single usb-c port for use. another huge downgrade.also this mac has the fancy new fingerprint scanner unlock and yet it forces me to re-enter my password constantly. so what is the point of a fingerprint scanner if i still need to re-enter my password 80% of the time?the keyboard also feels cheap and is very uncomfortable to use, another downgrade from my 2018 mac. literally this thing feels like a massive downgrade in nearly every way.\n",

      "Review: i purchased a macbook air (late 2020) from amazon on september 17th.  after a week of use, the screen has lines on it.  before the 30-day return window was up, i brought it to the apple store (twice).  the apple store, would not replace the unit and the staff would not send the unit out to be fixed at no cost. the store claimed damage was done to the laptop.  an unacceptable response where the laptop was used over a week with normal use, on a desk. this is a defect, not damage.  additionally, employee at the apple store, said that he could only swap it out if we purchased it from apple directly.  this is unacceptable, i purchased this unit from amazon which is an authorized apple retailer.  the same policies need to be applied, or why bother having authorized retailers.the screens on the m1 macbook airs are fragile and are of poor quality.  apple wont stand behind its product and fix it. amazon will take back the laptop and im getting a full refund.  apple needs to address the screen issue on their laptops, improve their warranty and retrain staff.  the m1 macbook air has poor components, poor warranty and the apple staff are not handling these issues well.  apple is blaming customers for apples poor build quality.\n",

      "Review: the 2020 macbook air bigsur os is one of the newest computers on the market at the moment and one of apples best designs. apple has had many macbook models throughout their many years of being the best electronic company, but the bigsur os has many features that other models and other company computers do not have. this macbook comes with high quality upload speed, all-day battery life, and superfast memory, which makes it the best choice for any computer or laptop right now. for a student and any other user, upload speed is definitely one of the most important qualities on a computer. this macbooks upload speed is fast enough that it can be considered a gaming laptop also. it has an apple m1 chip with an eight-core cpu which delivers up to almost four times as fast as past generations. this m1 chip is designed by apple designers themselves which other companies do not have access to. this bigsur is the quickest computer on the computer and laptop market which puts apple as the highest revenue electronic company. battery-life is another quality that is essential to many people, especially a student in the year 2021. many universities and high schools have switched to using mainly online tests, textbooks, notes, and activities. all day battery-life is important because some students are using their computer up to nine hours a day with school, homework, and studying for tests and quizzes. this macbook uses lithium polymer batteries which provide up to 18 hours of battery life. these batteries also are good for the environment and conservation. these are the best batteries for computers because they provide the best life and are good for the environment. good memory and lots of storage are also crucial qualities of a computer. this macbook can be used for up to ten years if there are not any software problems. this macbook has eight gb of unified memory that makes everything you do have fast upload speed and responsiveness. having enough memory and storage is great. for example, a student or a teacher would need to save documents, projects, notes and many more things. if there is not enough storage to do those things that a student needs to do then things will end up lost and not recovered. a lot of storage is also needed for a gamer because there needs to be space to download the games and have room for any spontaneous updates that might occur. good memory and storage are important to many people and that's what makes the bigsur os the best computer on the market. the macbook bigsur has many pros that other computers just do not have and is a reasonable price for all the features it comes with. this model is an amazing choice for students, teachers, gamers, engineers, it workers, and anyone who uses their computer a lot. the macbook bigsur os definitely continues to be one of the top rated computers and gives users a big bang for their buck.\n",

      "Review: macbook review apple has created many technological wonders throughout the time of the business, and the mac is no exception. i have had different laptops before highschool, like chromebooks, so i knew what i liked and did not like. after about two months of searching, i landed on the macbook.  when researching which laptop to buy for highschool, i landed upon the macbook for its reliable battery, the great software, and the modern features brought by the macbook, like touch i.d. and siri. the modern aspects of the macbook are beyond great, and serve many purposes that other laptops fail to incorporate. the first one is fingerprint recognition. when i had old laptops, i always had to remember every character of the password, and it was just a plain hassle. now, however, apple has a fingerprint scanner built into the computer itself, which i find extremely useful. between my school passwords, my home passwords, and other important information, that is a lot to keep track of. now, though, all i need is my fingerprint and i can get into all of my accounts with my fingerprint. also, the macbook comes with siri, a virtual assistant to do tasks and find different files on the mac. there are many different papers, files, and websites needed to keep track of, and finding all those efficiently is almost impossible on your own. but, siri makes it easier. to activate siri, all you have to do is simply say hey, siri and the assistant will appear. siri responds to what is said, so if i say, hey siri, find review 2 from google drive, the document will appear seconds later. although the modern technologies of the macbook are important, just as important is the software. many laptops lack the software that a high-end desktop would have, but this does not apply to apples macbook. first, the mac has capabilities that of gaming desktop computers. safari is the macs main browser, so what happens if for some reason i need to use google chrome? well, the mac has the ability to run not only two but three different utilities at once, google chrome, safari, and bing. also, the software of the mac allows you to also play desktop games when you want to. most laptops are meant for business or school, like the macbook, but not all of them can perform as well as the mac for games. sometimes, after school, i explore and test the limits of my laptop just to get a sense for what the max is. i expected the macbook to do somewhat poorly, but i thought that it actually did pretty well. another reason why the macbook is great is because of the battery. the batteries for every computer seem the same, but once looked at in-depth, not all batteries are equal. the macbook has a very long battery life compared to another laptop, like a chromebook. when i first used my macbook, i used it without charging it until it needed it. how long did it last after starting at 50%? almost one day with no charge. the chromebook i had when i was in middle school would need to be charged after about five hours of use. also, the battery uses an optimizing system. when the battery is below 30%, the system turns the battery power done, and thus turns down the brightness of the screen. this helps to maintain the battery for a longer period of time. not only is the battery great, but for many other reasons this is the best laptop i have had. the macbook is a modern, efficient laptop for not only students but for all kinds of people. from the battery life, to the software and the modern features, the macbook is a great laptop to use, no matter who you are and what you do. the mac will change not only how to get things done, but your view of a laptop forever.\n",

      "Review: update 12-15-2020 - after three weeks, i'm still really impressed with the m1 macbook air/8 core cpu/8 core gpu/512 ssd/8gb ram. --- my updated plea: make sure you get as much memory & storage as you can afford. special order one to your projected future need!remember, macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. not that long ago, 80 gb hard drives were huge... and upgradable. ram was upgradable. the ssd and the ram in these machines is not upgradable.the one issue for me has been that i am a memory hog! i tend to have lots of tabs open at once (i've caught myself with 50 (safari) open in one browser and 39 (chrome) in another!), while running affinity/final cut pro - and yes, the dreaded beach ball has reared it's ugly head. well, this got me to assess what i will be using the machine for and for how long.storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. ram is another story. when you constantly use up ram, the system starts using \"swap memory\" where it uses the ssd to store temporary files. one of the youtube reviewers (created labs) explains it like this: ram memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. writing to the ssd is like writing on paper with a pencil. it can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. it will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these m1 macbooks, none of the parts are replaceable. the ssd and the ram are soldered onto the board.***as ridiculously expensive as apple ram is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 gb.i really doubt that apple will be making machines with user upgradable ram after the switch from intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end pro models.there is also the fact that if i am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a m1 with a fan will be helpful. upgrading to the cheaper ($699+upgrades) m1 mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the pro apps, but i need a laptop, so... so, that is why i'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the macbook pro m1), with 16 gb ram & 1 tb ssd.***a note on browsers, safari is by far the best browser to run on the m1, at least for now. i always had issues with saving web pages as pdf files in chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. in safari, it's worked perfectly.------i purchased the macbook air m1, 8 core gpu, and 8 core cpu model, with 512 gb ssd and 8 gb ram in person at the apple store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. i traded in my (mnyh2ll/a) - 2017 12\" macbook with the intel m3 processor, 256 gb ssd, 8 gb ram. i kept my charging adapter & c-cable (which are both compatible with the m1 late 2020 macbook air), so ended up with a $330 apple store instant credit towards the m1.the m1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including final cut & logic pro. admittedly the 2017 mb was the bottom of the line and i suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single c-port fiasco.i likely would have gone with the 7 core gpu model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but i wanted 512 gb of ssd space, so i paid more by going with eh 8 core. from everything that i've seen, the lack of more ram upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many gpu intensive \"pro apps\" running at the same time.i would never have dreamed of running final cut or logic pro on the 2017 macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.i would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball \"not responding\" issues, or if you have non-apple programs that have not been compiled for the m1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the m1. if however, you really need a machine that is much more capable, faster and cooler running than the intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable mac.\n",

      "Review: i've had a variety of apple equipment in my life-- but also microsoft surface, surface laptops, chromebooks, and more. i'm an open minded technology user and tend to go with best of breed or technology that pushes the envelope of what is possible. i like well designed hardware that looks and feels good, and works well.i bought this one open box, that shouldn't matter at all, and it doesn't. it arrived from amazon warehouse deals as \"like new\" condition with \"like new box\" and the unit had no scratches/scrapes on it and was missing 3 months of warranty-- i'm happy to have the remainder.the latest macbook i had was the 12\" macbook from several years back. it was quite nice but was too small for me. this one has continued to improve on the screen, battery life and certainly has improved on the performance front.the unit is thin, svelte, and heavy. i mean, it could be a solid block of metal and i would expect the same heft. it's solid. this is not a bad thing for a device that is this thin & small to add some durability to what could otherwise be a very delicate device.the keyboard is very solid with a nice clickety-click, i am not able to tell a difference from this keyboard to the generations that were rather \"controversial\" and i very much do appreciate the touch id in the power button.having two usb-c ports is very welcomed compared to my previous which had only one.when looking at the performance of the m1 chip and all previous models, especially the 12\" macbook, and comparing to the prices those still sell for, it was a no brainer to go with this model. even compared to the macbook pro m1, there is a very slight difference between the two and for a rather light user the cost here was really an incredible value.i love windows for some things. i have windows running on this unit as well with parallels-- easy and simple-- do note you will need to download arm windows 10 media for this unit-- i was not able to find a way to migrate my previous vm from intel based.  it runs very well here and with no issues. very fast.one thing that didn't work great for me-- maybe it's me-- maybe it's mac os-- was plugging it in to a usb-c dock. i have a standard setup at home with 3 monitors, usb based external bose speakers, keyboard, mouse, and typically as i cycle through chromebooks and windows devices, i'm able to plug in and fairly easily extend / activate those monitors, use the peripherals and printer/etc. in this case i haven't had success getting this mac to work with my usb-c based dock and accessories-- to be determined.the screen is beautiful, the hardware is unbelievably solid, the speed is amazing.  i also have a surface laptop that i love, but for the mac variety, this is my perfect equivalent.\n",

      "Review: picked up this model on sale for $799. if you can get it on sale, i'd recommend it even over the new m2 macbook air (if you're getting the base model) for those who want a capable machine that can handle day to day tasks and don't need all the bells and whistles of a pro model.this has actually replaced a windows machine that i was using for a long time for my daily workflow, and even with only 8 gb of memory compared to 16 on the windows one, i find that this machine runs much better. it runs right out of the box without needing to spend a couple hours uninstalling bloat that comes standard with almost every windows laptop that sucks up my ram and cpu if i don't remove it. the only downside is that the 256 gb of ssd is a bit light, but since i mostly work off the cloud anyway, it's not a deal breaker. if you do need more, i would recommend buying a model with that space built in as you would need to get an external drive otherwise.pros vs. m2 air:- ssd is a bit faster (as it's two 128 gb modules running in parallel, while the new one is a single module) which also is a slight boost to longevity.- there is no notch on the display (i personally don't mind it, but if that's a sticking point for you this or the 13\" m2 pro model would probably serve you better).- slightly improved cooling system (neither air model has an active cooling setup, but the integrated heat spreader on the m2 model is a fair bit smaller so it throttles itself a bit sooner), but not major if you don't plan on pushing too hard (and if you are, the m2/m1pro/m1max mbp is probably better suited for you anyway).- i find that i like the way the keyboard types a little more on the m1 model over the m2. it's definitely a matter of personal preference, but it feels a bit nicer to type on for me. might be down to the fact that it uses the traditional wedge shape which gives a little bit of an angle to the keyboard, where the m2 mba is more like the 2021 mbp shape.cons vs. m2 air:- no dedicated magsafe charging port, meaning that you only get one available usb-c port to use when charging.- overall system performance is a bit lower than the m2, but not really by a whole lot. if you're not planning on really stressing the system you won't notice.- function keys are only half height, while the m2 has full height keys. again, personal preference, but as someone with slightly larger hands who normally uses larger keyboards i prefer the full size keys.- webcam is only 720p instead of 1080p on the m2. i don't use it that much, but if you do plan to be doing a lot of zoom, facetime, etc. you may want to keep that in mind. it's still not bad, but the quality difference is something that you will notice.- sound quality is a tad weaker in my opinion, but nothing major, and i usually use my airpods or some other external speakers/headphones anyway.on the whole, it's still a great macbook. sure it's more expensive than plenty of windows laptops, but the battery performance is solid, and even with only 8 gb of ram (if you want more, go for a macbook pro instead), it's still overall a solid option for light to medium duty workloads due to how optimized the new apple silicon is. on programs that take full advantage of it, the boost in performance is massive. even with using rosetta for older intel-based programs, it's still quite fast. compared to any intel machine that came before it, it blows them out of the park with superior performance and battery life.if you can get it on sale, or a good refurbished one (in that case i recommend going directly to apple), it's probably one of the best laptops on the market right now. for students and anyone looking for a mac that's lightweight but capable, this is a solid choice.\n",

      "Review: i love linux, i can tolerate windows, usually don't like mac. it's fine folks like what they like for me, linux gives the most choice is extensible, and runs so fast on even older hardware, you get infinite support you don't get harassed to use cortana, siri, candy crush itunes etc etc.  mac usually they push you so hard in this echo system for a lot of stuff i really don't like. it used to be just getting music out of itunes was a pain.well here we are in 2021. i mainly work on linux these days, and wanted a unix style mac because working remote i just needed something with microsoft office, i need that. i am not doing windows development these days. i know there is wsl but there are trade offs on windows. not with mac --  for my use case, so i tried it... gave it another shot really. my timing was seemingly really good. these computer are fantastic. you know what i hate about laptops. when they are 150 degrees melting your nuts and it sounds like you have a jet pack on. i hate that i really do. all of my laptops do this. the mac m1 i am pleased to report doesn't. screw performance i mean that's great here, but the quiet and note heat that's the feature.this is coming from someone that doesn't want to like apple. they outsource all these jobs, their stuff is over priced right? i'm not so  sure about the price here. you can buy a mac pro 13 inch that's faster than an i9 for 1500 (if you get 16gb), and the battery is amazing, no heat, no fan, the sound is great, the screen is great, the keyboard is great, it's not a lenovo, but other than that it's about as good as you can get. this machine is so well thought out. i got the pro, the reason i take a lot of calls and wanted the slightly better sound, and boosted battery,but if you don't need that you can just get the air which doesn't have the horrible touch bar. don't get me wrong. the touch bar would be fine in addition to normal keys. that's where they went wrong here they got greedy. i digress. the only other issue i see here is the connectivity sucks. it needs ports on both sides and at least 2x ports.all these reviews are usually full of crap. it's just people getting free hardware and writing reviews so they can take a tax deduction, or they are sort marketing. this time it's true. this architecture is a significant advance especially in the laptop space. i 'm not sure if this will translate to a desktop-- risc vs cisc isn't new it been going on for decades, but  for laptops, this is a quantum leap. i don't see any reason for the work i'm doing to use a desktop computer a this point. i have complete portability, i can take calls (amazing calls), work on ms office, general development (vscode, all the jetbrains stuff, docker etc)... i mean for a lot of system stuff i'll still use i'd still use linux, but for work this is a great way to go. what a great product. it really really is. this i as strong of an endorsement i can give if you just need to be productive. after 8 months of hell no more fumbeling around with tpm chips, mics, no being able to share my screen, pleading with my computer to use the right audio device. i like it better than any other laptop i have ever had by far.this thing is really just that good. i've been i this industry for a long time. there are going to have to be some changes in competitors product lines, if apple continues to maintain this price point and deliver a product of this caliber. i have no question this one is going to eat market share fast. i'd imagine there will be a strong response fro intel, amd and the software companies.  it's difficult to justify purchasing any other laptop at this moment. i mean just get the air for 1200, just get the extra ram. maybe 500 gb. that's all most people are going to need. who cares if they release better ones in 6 months. they always do they'll probably cost too much. this is all you need.\n",

      "Review: introas a college student, having a reliable and portable workstation is extremely valuable. the new macbook air powered by the m1 chip is one of the most exciting devices recently released by apple. although it looks just like the previous models, the m1 chip delivers insanely great performance.design and buildsince its inception, macbook airs design and build were one of its core selling points, and the macbook air m1 is no exception. it has that signature aluminium body that youll see with the other macbook variants. the laptop not only looks premium but it definitely feels like your moneys worth. you can easily open this laptop with only one finger, this is possible because of the incredibly engineered hinge design done by apple. one of the things that the original macbook air lacked for a while was a decent display, gone are the days of a 720p panel. and brought is a beautiful p3 wide color gamut 2560*1440p panel, the overall viewing experience is awesome! the bezels are the same size as last year's model, which was kinda disappointing when compared to other laptops recently released, but it's not something that will ruin the overall viewing experience. the updated magic keyboard has better travel and also the gigantic mouse pad is always a blessing, im yet to find a trackpad on a laptop that i like better than the ones made by apple. the dual speaker grills on this laptop produce pretty decent sound, however, there is some slight distortion at high volumes.storagestorage is also very important as a college student. as you're going to need some space to store all your documents, files, and zoom lectures. the macbook air comes with up to 2tb of ssd storage. this specific model i have only had 128gb of storage which honestly should be fine for most students, and if you dont want to spend a lot of money you can always buy an external ssd or hard drive. this will cost you way less than what apple offers.portabilityas a college student in 2021, because of covid, it's been kinda different, (very small pause)all of our classes nowadays are held on zoom or some other online platform. so if you wanna use this laptop outside of a typical campus setting, then portability starts to matter. the macbook air weighs in at 2.75 pounds and is 15.6mm thick. this laptop will easily fit in most backups without feeling a noticeable weight difference. this is important to a lot of students, especially if you have back-to-back classes keeping in mind the average textbook weighs just over 4.6 pounds. this laptop also easily fits in most handbags for women who were wondering.reliability and batterythe apple macbook air has proven itself as one of the most reliable laptops for a student this past decade. the macbook air is going to be a more compelling laptop for the students this, because of its insanely reliable performance for its price, but let's talk about the chip thats made all this possible.the biggest change this year is no doubt the m1 chip, the arm-based chip is fast,  like stupid fast. applications open up real quick and the performance is consistently reliable. not only can it easily fly through day-to-day tasks like browsing the internet and typing research papers, but it can also handle intensive tasks such as 4k video editing, in fact, i managed to edit an entire 4k video on the m1 macbook air and the performance & exporting times were very impressive. anyway, that was sometimes impossible on the previous-gens of macbook air. now if you are considering this device for video editing then i would highly recommend the 16 gig variant.the next best thing aside from its insane performance is the incredible battery life, i think this is the best battery life i have ever seen on a laptop of this form factor. the laptop lasted me multiple days of light usage with the usual workload being typing, browsing, and streaming content. i can pull a full day of heavy usage with tasks like editing photos and videos.conclusionoverall theres a quote that says, speed is irrelevant if you are going in the wrong direction. (mahatma gandhi). the macbook air m1 has set a new benchmark for consistent performance and delivers insanely awesome battery life which makes the overall experience pretty fire. its portability, reliability, and speed not only make this a great investment for a student but also for anybody whos always on the go, and im personally really excited for the direction that apple is heading towards with their new m lineup of processers.\n",

      "Review: (heads-up, this review will be lengthy, but i wanted to cover every aspect to make sure you make the right buying choice).the macbook air has always been known as a popular choice for college students over the years due to the lightweight, slim design and good battery life. one caveat that has always plagued the macbook air of years past was underwhelming performance due to underclocked, lower-powered processors (which were always reserved for the pro line). that was why i always got a macbook pro in years past. this time around, when apple announced the new m1 chip, i was curious, so i watched hours and hours of reviews and decided to pull the trigger on the new air (the air has the same chipset as the macbook pro, with the same ghz at 3.2, while saving $300). i am on a budget, but i also didnt want to sacrifice performance, so i was a little nervous i was missing out by not getting the pro, but thankfully i have not had to sacrifice a thing.i am a full-time digital design student, so my workflow can be demanding at times with running adobe photoshop and adobe indesign, etc. i previously purchased a 2017 macbook pro and it was my daily driver until about mid-march when i made a grievous error and went out and purchased a lenovo yoga c940 with 16gb of ram, intel i7 processor at a whopping price tag of $1500.00. buyers remorse soon followed as the yoga was plagued with overheating issues, thermal throttling and absolutely horrific battery life. the only thing that i liked was the speaker set-up and the 4k touch screen. other than that, i was beyond disappointed. i sent it back, and went back to using my 2017 macbook pro, until i purchased this air.so the pros:fantastic battery lifei have a tough time killing the battery on this computer. it will easily last an entire day, and even longer if you arent totally hammering this thing with demanding apps like i do. its great to know you dont have to always carry a charger with you everywhere (you can carry from class to class, the coffee shop and back home and itll still have battery to spare). a win in my book.heat management and fanless designi am super nit-picky about heat management and fan noise when it comes to laptops, which is why i always love the macbooks and detest windows (hence sending the lenovo back).  the fact that this computer is fanless and manages to stay cool to the touch boggles my mind. i dont have to worry about a computer than will get so hot that you can fry an egg on it, or annoying fans kicking on. i also like that i dont have to worry about blocking any ventilation grills, since there is no fan. i can sit in bed with covers under this and not worry im blocking a fan exhaust.  again, another win in my book.slim designat 2.8 pounds, and having a tapered design, you can throw this thing in a backpack and not feel like youre lugging around a brick. i also liked the tapered design as its a little more ergonomic than my macbook pro that has some really sharp edges by the trackpad. its a nice change for someone that has to type up essays all of the time.keyboardgone are the butterfly mechanisms of macbooks past. one thing i really missed when i gave up my 2015 macbook pro was the keyboard! thankfully with the new air and pros, you get the scissor switch mechanisms back, so my fingers dont feel like theyre hitting bottom when typing for long periods of time.trackpadi love, love the force touch trackpad. i still believe apple has one of the best trackpad designs of any laptop out there. hands down. its smooth as butter.performancethis is the little machine that could. it puts my 2017 pro to shame. it also outperforms the lenovo that was supposed to be top of the line, at a fraction of the cost. i can have multiple tabs in safari open, photoshop, apple music, microsoft word, and this doesnt even break a sweat. i also like that i can do some light video editing on this. for most peopleespecially college studentsthis computers power should be more than sufficient. keep in mind if you are a professional videographer or photographer, you might want to opt for the pro as it does have a fan and can sustain heat management better in terms of thermal throttling. again, thats if youre editing like multiple 4k videos on a daily basis, but for college students or the average joe that may only need to do the occasional video projectno problem! this computer can handle it!screenits nice and bright, and the color accuracy is on point, which is important if you edit photos or videos in any capacity like i do.speakersi am a music junkie, and i have to constantly have music going when im working on school projects, and for such a thin and light laptop the speakers on this are actually pretty good. good stereo separation and punchy. they could do with a little more bass, and when you max the volume it can get a little faded, but thats to be expected for such small speaker drivers. i am more than pleased with them. they also work good for binge-watching shows on netflix.the cons (there are few):the webcamits a 720p webcam, and well, it looks like a 720p webcam. its a little grainy and washed out. it will do in a pinch, but youd think in 2020 wed get an upgrade on the webcam.the lack of portsin true apple fashion, the i/o is somewhat lacking. you have 2 thunderbolt 4 ports, of which you cannot plug in an external gpu, and are limited to one external monitor (this is a limit that apples m1 system on a chip, not the thunderbolt ports, which i am sure will be resolved in future iterations). i would have liked to have seen at least one usb-a port for legacy things like flash drives, etc. but thats just me being nit-picky.m1 chip running intel appsbecause apples m1 chip runs on arm and most apps are coded for intel, there are many apps that have not been optimized to run the new apple chip natively (like adobe creative cloud). you might run into a few glitches and hick-ups while app developers are getting up to speed. so far, i havent really run into any issues, but there is that possibility. i am sure here soon it wont be a problem. again, its nit-picking.--to sum up: this macbook air is a winner. i would absolutely not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, and i would absolutely buy it again. you get the performance and the portability, while saving some $ by not buying the pro line. i am very happy with this computer and think i might just have come as close as i can to the perfect laptop for my needs.happy shopping!\n",

      "Review: i was hesitant to get a smaller macbook after my 15\" 2015 macbook pro started to suffer from keyboard issues.  i repaired the keyboard twice, so there must have been something wrong with voltage regulation to it.anyhow, i couldn't resist the idea of an arm based macbook, so i went with the 2020 13\" macbook air since i don't think the pro model had apple silicon yet.  i could be wrong on that.long story short, it meets all my needs with flying colors!  it turns out that i'm perfectly comfortable with a 13\" screen and that i don't need a bigger one.everything great about this macbook:- it's *fast*!  don't let the \"air\" moniker deceive you.  unless you're into heavy gaming, this is the laptop for you.  arm processors are the future of consumer computing.- the battery life is *insane*.  i still can't comprehend how many hours this thing survives unplugged.  i take it on flights across the country and never need to plug in or get worried that i will run out of power, even when i'm charging my phone off it!- it's slim and light!  perfect for traveling.- it is completely solid state with no moving parts!  no fan whirring or anything like that.- as an extension of the first point, it runs arm builds of windows insanely well with parallels.  it can even run halo: ce at near full speed!- macos is very stable.- the retina screen is nice.- despite what people are saying about the camera, it's actually better than the one on my old macbook pro.  (this isn't to say that the camera is *good*, but it's adequate imo)- all things considered, the m1 macbook air is incredible value and really a great deal for the price.- it has a larger touchpad than my old macbook pro but not quite as bit as the one on current 13\" macbook pros.  i find this preferable because it is just the right size where i'm not constantly hitting it with my palm as i type.  if you type a lot then the touchpad on this laptop will probably annoy you less while still having plenty of surface area.- no touchbar!!!  halleluja!!!!- decent sound from the speakers considering the size constraint.there are some cons, but they are pretty minor imo:- only the left side has usb-c ports, in contrast to the pro which has them on both sides.  the right side *does* have an analog audio jack, however, if that's useful to you.  however, i've managed fine without usb on the right side.- it would be nice if i didn't have to click the fingerprint sensor button to get it to sense my finger and wake the system.  on pros, the fingerprint sensor is always active.- if you are one of the 3 people on the planet who want the touchbar, this will not have it. (i however consider this a good thing)- although the speakers have improved in quality since previous air models, the pro is still going to have better sounding speakers.  you may feel like you've gotten a bit of a downgrade in that regard if you are coming from a pro model.  personally, i've gotten used to it plus i use airpods most of the time anyway.- the air does not have an hdmi port, but you can buy an (expensive) adapter that will provide hdmi.- storage capacity is workable but limited.  would be nice to get at least 1 tb of storage in the future.  in the meantime i just back stuff up on to an external drive and periodically clear my downloads folder.i'm a software engineer and the m1 macbook air exceeds my needs and expectations.  i think i'll just be buying the air model in the future because it's terrific value for the price point.  $999 might be expensive for some, but i can assure you that it's a robust laptop so you are saving money in the long run.  i've owned many non-apple laptops in the past and i ended up hating all of them.  on the other hand, i never regret owning an apple device.  this is coming from someone who formerly used windows and linux.  i got tired of both the hardware and software breaking down quickly.  apple isn't perfect... my last macbook pro chugged along for over 6 years until the keyboard repeatedly failed, but that still beats all previous laptops i owned that had numerous problems unrelated to how i treated them.\n",

      "Review: omg! this is such an incredible product. perfect keyboard, perfect weight, perfect battery life, perfect trackpad, perfect performance, perfect touch id, perfect feel, perfect build, perfect look, perfect size, perfect stereo sound, perfect screen, perfect noise absence as not having a fan! i mean, it doesn't have a fan and it doesn't get hot most of the times. wtf?! it's the only laptop i've been able to use in my bed for x amount of hours and it is sooo comfortable to do it. it truly is one of the best products out there and it is totally worth the investment, because that's how i see it, not even as spending, that's just how good it is. i'm enthusiastic because this is for sure the best device apple has created in terms of price/what you get, and it will probably stay in that position for a couple of years. this is game-changing and revolutionary. the computer feels as if it will last 10+ years, honestly. i highly recommend it. btw, it is so good my girlfriend decided to get one for herself because she just couldn't get over the first time she used it, and just how beautiful it is and pleasurable to look at from any perspective... this laptop is so ridiculously perfect that you can even open it with one hand and in just a couple of seconds, you will be ready to use it as it has an always-on feature that allows you to get down to the working right away. that is probably the best feat. true tone is also really good, as it is automatic brightness adjustment and dark mode, they sit together perfectly well. get it! you won't regret it at any moment. truly a high-end experience. oh, and... it looks elegant at any angle, and which is most important, classy it feels.\n",

      "Review: not much to say, excellent product overall. no cons except lack of ports. all day+ battery life, excellent screen. keyboard is good as well. i have the 8 gb ram version but haven't seen any lag due to it. use it often to run demanding simulations and it has not disappointed me so far.i was little concerned with the m1 chip and compatibility. however, x86-64 runs well enough, though cpu/ram usage is a bit higher (dropbox, for example). if you are using native versions, its far better than any x86-64 mobile cpus on market.\n",

      "Review: i've owned this laptop for a year and a half, and felt compelled to take time out of my frantic day to note that i really think this computer is a giant step backward for the macbook air model and for macintosh as a brand compared to my old 2013 macbook air running yosemite.the lack of a mag-safe connection for the charger is really unforgivable, and this computer has wound up on the floor so frequently that i now have placed the dog bed where the laptop is likely to land.  the keys are beginning to stick.  the screen is beautiful, but gives me a terrible headache.  the memory pressure issue with the m1 is also a real problem in safari, which locks up about every three weeks if you have a lot of windows open-- and it take a long time to force quit safely and recover lost work.  the laptop is also too big-- that extra inch or so of width really makes a difference.  the loss of practical functionality in itunes is really disappointing, imovie and garage band have become much, much harder to use in big sur as well, and apple's insistence on trying to force me into using the kloud is both intensely irritating and very dangerous for my business, where confidentiality is absolutely critical.it is true that the processing speed for offline tasks is impressive-- my music projects do sound much better-- and photo and video editing is great.but the m1's speed is not enough of a reason for me to bond with this computer.  as the months have rolled by, honestly, i've come to kind of hate it.  i'm looking forward to refurbishing my old macbook air, and i'm thinking this may be the last apple product that i buy, even though i can't think of a suitable alternative.i am a 64-year old professional health care provider who has been in it since the early 1980s, and while it's true that i have generally been very unhappy with how gratuitously awful the end-user interface of most tech products have become over the last quarter century, there are some computers that i have actually liked-- my old macbook air was definitely one of them.  this is definitely not.\n",

      "Review: ive owned macs for over 25 years and this is the worst ive ever owned. first off, the mouse buttons are a new horrible design that often do not recognize mouse clicks. clicking this mouse is the worst experience ive ever had on any computer before. my previous 2018 mac was much better in so many ways.also i hate that this new mac only has 2 ports both being usb-c. one is used to charge which means you only have a single usb-c port for use. another huge downgrade.also this mac has the fancy new fingerprint scanner unlock and yet it forces me to re-enter my password constantly. so what is the point of a fingerprint scanner if i still need to re-enter my password 80% of the time?the keyboard also feels cheap and is very uncomfortable to use, another downgrade from my 2018 mac. literally this thing feels like a massive downgrade in nearly every way.\n",

      "Review: i purchased a macbook air (late 2020) from amazon on september 17th.  after a week of use, the screen has lines on it.  before the 30-day return window was up, i brought it to the apple store (twice).  the apple store, would not replace the unit and the staff would not send the unit out to be fixed at no cost. the store claimed damage was done to the laptop.  an unacceptable response where the laptop was used over a week with normal use, on a desk. this is a defect, not damage.  additionally, employee at the apple store, said that he could only swap it out if we purchased it from apple directly.  this is unacceptable, i purchased this unit from amazon which is an authorized apple retailer.  the same policies need to be applied, or why bother having authorized retailers.the screens on the m1 macbook airs are fragile and are of poor quality.  apple wont stand behind its product and fix it. amazon will take back the laptop and im getting a full refund.  apple needs to address the screen issue on their laptops, improve their warranty and retrain staff.  the m1 macbook air has poor components, poor warranty and the apple staff are not handling these issues well.  apple is blaming customers for apples poor build quality.\n",

      "Review: the 2020 macbook air bigsur os is one of the newest computers on the market at the moment and one of apples best designs. apple has had many macbook models throughout their many years of being the best electronic company, but the bigsur os has many features that other models and other company computers do not have. this macbook comes with high quality upload speed, all-day battery life, and superfast memory, which makes it the best choice for any computer or laptop right now. for a student and any other user, upload speed is definitely one of the most important qualities on a computer. this macbooks upload speed is fast enough that it can be considered a gaming laptop also. it has an apple m1 chip with an eight-core cpu which delivers up to almost four times as fast as past generations. this m1 chip is designed by apple designers themselves which other companies do not have access to. this bigsur is the quickest computer on the computer and laptop market which puts apple as the highest revenue electronic company. battery-life is another quality that is essential to many people, especially a student in the year 2021. many universities and high schools have switched to using mainly online tests, textbooks, notes, and activities. all day battery-life is important because some students are using their computer up to nine hours a day with school, homework, and studying for tests and quizzes. this macbook uses lithium polymer batteries which provide up to 18 hours of battery life. these batteries also are good for the environment and conservation. these are the best batteries for computers because they provide the best life and are good for the environment. good memory and lots of storage are also crucial qualities of a computer. this macbook can be used for up to ten years if there are not any software problems. this macbook has eight gb of unified memory that makes everything you do have fast upload speed and responsiveness. having enough memory and storage is great. for example, a student or a teacher would need to save documents, projects, notes and many more things. if there is not enough storage to do those things that a student needs to do then things will end up lost and not recovered. a lot of storage is also needed for a gamer because there needs to be space to download the games and have room for any spontaneous updates that might occur. good memory and storage are important to many people and that's what makes the bigsur os the best computer on the market. the macbook bigsur has many pros that other computers just do not have and is a reasonable price for all the features it comes with. this model is an amazing choice for students, teachers, gamers, engineers, it workers, and anyone who uses their computer a lot. the macbook bigsur os definitely continues to be one of the top rated computers and gives users a big bang for their buck.\n",

      "Review: macbook review apple has created many technological wonders throughout the time of the business, and the mac is no exception. i have had different laptops before highschool, like chromebooks, so i knew what i liked and did not like. after about two months of searching, i landed on the macbook.  when researching which laptop to buy for highschool, i landed upon the macbook for its reliable battery, the great software, and the modern features brought by the macbook, like touch i.d. and siri. the modern aspects of the macbook are beyond great, and serve many purposes that other laptops fail to incorporate. the first one is fingerprint recognition. when i had old laptops, i always had to remember every character of the password, and it was just a plain hassle. now, however, apple has a fingerprint scanner built into the computer itself, which i find extremely useful. between my school passwords, my home passwords, and other important information, that is a lot to keep track of. now, though, all i need is my fingerprint and i can get into all of my accounts with my fingerprint. also, the macbook comes with siri, a virtual assistant to do tasks and find different files on the mac. there are many different papers, files, and websites needed to keep track of, and finding all those efficiently is almost impossible on your own. but, siri makes it easier. to activate siri, all you have to do is simply say hey, siri and the assistant will appear. siri responds to what is said, so if i say, hey siri, find review 2 from google drive, the document will appear seconds later. although the modern technologies of the macbook are important, just as important is the software. many laptops lack the software that a high-end desktop would have, but this does not apply to apples macbook. first, the mac has capabilities that of gaming desktop computers. safari is the macs main browser, so what happens if for some reason i need to use google chrome? well, the mac has the ability to run not only two but three different utilities at once, google chrome, safari, and bing. also, the software of the mac allows you to also play desktop games when you want to. most laptops are meant for business or school, like the macbook, but not all of them can perform as well as the mac for games. sometimes, after school, i explore and test the limits of my laptop just to get a sense for what the max is. i expected the macbook to do somewhat poorly, but i thought that it actually did pretty well. another reason why the macbook is great is because of the battery. the batteries for every computer seem the same, but once looked at in-depth, not all batteries are equal. the macbook has a very long battery life compared to another laptop, like a chromebook. when i first used my macbook, i used it without charging it until it needed it. how long did it last after starting at 50%? almost one day with no charge. the chromebook i had when i was in middle school would need to be charged after about five hours of use. also, the battery uses an optimizing system. when the battery is below 30%, the system turns the battery power done, and thus turns down the brightness of the screen. this helps to maintain the battery for a longer period of time. not only is the battery great, but for many other reasons this is the best laptop i have had. the macbook is a modern, efficient laptop for not only students but for all kinds of people. from the battery life, to the software and the modern features, the macbook is a great laptop to use, no matter who you are and what you do. the mac will change not only how to get things done, but your view of a laptop forever.\n",

      "Review: update 12-15-2020 - after three weeks, i'm still really impressed with the m1 macbook air/8 core cpu/8 core gpu/512 ssd/8gb ram. --- my updated plea: make sure you get as much memory & storage as you can afford. special order one to your projected future need!remember, macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. not that long ago, 80 gb hard drives were huge... and upgradable. ram was upgradable. the ssd and the ram in these machines is not upgradable.the one issue for me has been that i am a memory hog! i tend to have lots of tabs open at once (i've caught myself with 50 (safari) open in one browser and 39 (chrome) in another!), while running affinity/final cut pro - and yes, the dreaded beach ball has reared it's ugly head. well, this got me to assess what i will be using the machine for and for how long.storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. ram is another story. when you constantly use up ram, the system starts using \"swap memory\" where it uses the ssd to store temporary files. one of the youtube reviewers (created labs) explains it like this: ram memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. writing to the ssd is like writing on paper with a pencil. it can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. it will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these m1 macbooks, none of the parts are replaceable. the ssd and the ram are soldered onto the board.***as ridiculously expensive as apple ram is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 gb.i really doubt that apple will be making machines with user upgradable ram after the switch from intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end pro models.there is also the fact that if i am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a m1 with a fan will be helpful. upgrading to the cheaper ($699+upgrades) m1 mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the pro apps, but i need a laptop, so... so, that is why i'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the macbook pro m1), with 16 gb ram & 1 tb ssd.***a note on browsers, safari is by far the best browser to run on the m1, at least for now. i always had issues with saving web pages as pdf files in chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. in safari, it's worked perfectly.------i purchased the macbook air m1, 8 core gpu, and 8 core cpu model, with 512 gb ssd and 8 gb ram in person at the apple store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. i traded in my (mnyh2ll/a) - 2017 12\" macbook with the intel m3 processor, 256 gb ssd, 8 gb ram. i kept my charging adapter & c-cable (which are both compatible with the m1 late 2020 macbook air), so ended up with a $330 apple store instant credit towards the m1.the m1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including final cut & logic pro. admittedly the 2017 mb was the bottom of the line and i suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single c-port fiasco.i likely would have gone with the 7 core gpu model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but i wanted 512 gb of ssd space, so i paid more by going with eh 8 core. from everything that i've seen, the lack of more ram upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many gpu intensive \"pro apps\" running at the same time.i would never have dreamed of running final cut or logic pro on the 2017 macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.i would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball \"not responding\" issues, or if you have non-apple programs that have not been compiled for the m1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the m1. if however, you really need a machine that is much more capable, faster and cooler running than the intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable mac.\n",

      "Review: i've had a variety of apple equipment in my life-- but also microsoft surface, surface laptops, chromebooks, and more. i'm an open minded technology user and tend to go with best of breed or technology that pushes the envelope of what is possible. i like well designed hardware that looks and feels good, and works well.i bought this one open box, that shouldn't matter at all, and it doesn't. it arrived from amazon warehouse deals as \"like new\" condition with \"like new box\" and the unit had no scratches/scrapes on it and was missing 3 months of warranty-- i'm happy to have the remainder.the latest macbook i had was the 12\" macbook from several years back. it was quite nice but was too small for me. this one has continued to improve on the screen, battery life and certainly has improved on the performance front.the unit is thin, svelte, and heavy. i mean, it could be a solid block of metal and i would expect the same heft. it's solid. this is not a bad thing for a device that is this thin & small to add some durability to what could otherwise be a very delicate device.the keyboard is very solid with a nice clickety-click, i am not able to tell a difference from this keyboard to the generations that were rather \"controversial\" and i very much do appreciate the touch id in the power button.having two usb-c ports is very welcomed compared to my previous which had only one.when looking at the performance of the m1 chip and all previous models, especially the 12\" macbook, and comparing to the prices those still sell for, it was a no brainer to go with this model. even compared to the macbook pro m1, there is a very slight difference between the two and for a rather light user the cost here was really an incredible value.i love windows for some things. i have windows running on this unit as well with parallels-- easy and simple-- do note you will need to download arm windows 10 media for this unit-- i was not able to find a way to migrate my previous vm from intel based.  it runs very well here and with no issues. very fast.one thing that didn't work great for me-- maybe it's me-- maybe it's mac os-- was plugging it in to a usb-c dock. i have a standard setup at home with 3 monitors, usb based external bose speakers, keyboard, mouse, and typically as i cycle through chromebooks and windows devices, i'm able to plug in and fairly easily extend / activate those monitors, use the peripherals and printer/etc. in this case i haven't had success getting this mac to work with my usb-c based dock and accessories-- to be determined.the screen is beautiful, the hardware is unbelievably solid, the speed is amazing.  i also have a surface laptop that i love, but for the mac variety, this is my perfect equivalent.\n",

      "Review: picked up this model on sale for $799. if you can get it on sale, i'd recommend it even over the new m2 macbook air (if you're getting the base model) for those who want a capable machine that can handle day to day tasks and don't need all the bells and whistles of a pro model.this has actually replaced a windows machine that i was using for a long time for my daily workflow, and even with only 8 gb of memory compared to 16 on the windows one, i find that this machine runs much better. it runs right out of the box without needing to spend a couple hours uninstalling bloat that comes standard with almost every windows laptop that sucks up my ram and cpu if i don't remove it. the only downside is that the 256 gb of ssd is a bit light, but since i mostly work off the cloud anyway, it's not a deal breaker. if you do need more, i would recommend buying a model with that space built in as you would need to get an external drive otherwise.pros vs. m2 air:- ssd is a bit faster (as it's two 128 gb modules running in parallel, while the new one is a single module) which also is a slight boost to longevity.- there is no notch on the display (i personally don't mind it, but if that's a sticking point for you this or the 13\" m2 pro model would probably serve you better).- slightly improved cooling system (neither air model has an active cooling setup, but the integrated heat spreader on the m2 model is a fair bit smaller so it throttles itself a bit sooner), but not major if you don't plan on pushing too hard (and if you are, the m2/m1pro/m1max mbp is probably better suited for you anyway).- i find that i like the way the keyboard types a little more on the m1 model over the m2. it's definitely a matter of personal preference, but it feels a bit nicer to type on for me. might be down to the fact that it uses the traditional wedge shape which gives a little bit of an angle to the keyboard, where the m2 mba is more like the 2021 mbp shape.cons vs. m2 air:- no dedicated magsafe charging port, meaning that you only get one available usb-c port to use when charging.- overall system performance is a bit lower than the m2, but not really by a whole lot. if you're not planning on really stressing the system you won't notice.- function keys are only half height, while the m2 has full height keys. again, personal preference, but as someone with slightly larger hands who normally uses larger keyboards i prefer the full size keys.- webcam is only 720p instead of 1080p on the m2. i don't use it that much, but if you do plan to be doing a lot of zoom, facetime, etc. you may want to keep that in mind. it's still not bad, but the quality difference is something that you will notice.- sound quality is a tad weaker in my opinion, but nothing major, and i usually use my airpods or some other external speakers/headphones anyway.on the whole, it's still a great macbook. sure it's more expensive than plenty of windows laptops, but the battery performance is solid, and even with only 8 gb of ram (if you want more, go for a macbook pro instead), it's still overall a solid option for light to medium duty workloads due to how optimized the new apple silicon is. on programs that take full advantage of it, the boost in performance is massive. even with using rosetta for older intel-based programs, it's still quite fast. compared to any intel machine that came before it, it blows them out of the park with superior performance and battery life.if you can get it on sale, or a good refurbished one (in that case i recommend going directly to apple), it's probably one of the best laptops on the market right now. for students and anyone looking for a mac that's lightweight but capable, this is a solid choice.\n",

      "Review: i love linux, i can tolerate windows, usually don't like mac. it's fine folks like what they like for me, linux gives the most choice is extensible, and runs so fast on even older hardware, you get infinite support you don't get harassed to use cortana, siri, candy crush itunes etc etc.  mac usually they push you so hard in this echo system for a lot of stuff i really don't like. it used to be just getting music out of itunes was a pain.well here we are in 2021. i mainly work on linux these days, and wanted a unix style mac because working remote i just needed something with microsoft office, i need that. i am not doing windows development these days. i know there is wsl but there are trade offs on windows. not with mac --  for my use case, so i tried it... gave it another shot really. my timing was seemingly really good. these computer are fantastic. you know what i hate about laptops. when they are 150 degrees melting your nuts and it sounds like you have a jet pack on. i hate that i really do. all of my laptops do this. the mac m1 i am pleased to report doesn't. screw performance i mean that's great here, but the quiet and note heat that's the feature.this is coming from someone that doesn't want to like apple. they outsource all these jobs, their stuff is over priced right? i'm not so  sure about the price here. you can buy a mac pro 13 inch that's faster than an i9 for 1500 (if you get 16gb), and the battery is amazing, no heat, no fan, the sound is great, the screen is great, the keyboard is great, it's not a lenovo, but other than that it's about as good as you can get. this machine is so well thought out. i got the pro, the reason i take a lot of calls and wanted the slightly better sound, and boosted battery,but if you don't need that you can just get the air which doesn't have the horrible touch bar. don't get me wrong. the touch bar would be fine in addition to normal keys. that's where they went wrong here they got greedy. i digress. the only other issue i see here is the connectivity sucks. it needs ports on both sides and at least 2x ports.all these reviews are usually full of crap. it's just people getting free hardware and writing reviews so they can take a tax deduction, or they are sort marketing. this time it's true. this architecture is a significant advance especially in the laptop space. i 'm not sure if this will translate to a desktop-- risc vs cisc isn't new it been going on for decades, but  for laptops, this is a quantum leap. i don't see any reason for the work i'm doing to use a desktop computer a this point. i have complete portability, i can take calls (amazing calls), work on ms office, general development (vscode, all the jetbrains stuff, docker etc)... i mean for a lot of system stuff i'll still use i'd still use linux, but for work this is a great way to go. what a great product. it really really is. this i as strong of an endorsement i can give if you just need to be productive. after 8 months of hell no more fumbeling around with tpm chips, mics, no being able to share my screen, pleading with my computer to use the right audio device. i like it better than any other laptop i have ever had by far.this thing is really just that good. i've been i this industry for a long time. there are going to have to be some changes in competitors product lines, if apple continues to maintain this price point and deliver a product of this caliber. i have no question this one is going to eat market share fast. i'd imagine there will be a strong response fro intel, amd and the software companies.  it's difficult to justify purchasing any other laptop at this moment. i mean just get the air for 1200, just get the extra ram. maybe 500 gb. that's all most people are going to need. who cares if they release better ones in 6 months. they always do they'll probably cost too much. this is all you need.\n",

      "Review: introas a college student, having a reliable and portable workstation is extremely valuable. the new macbook air powered by the m1 chip is one of the most exciting devices recently released by apple. although it looks just like the previous models, the m1 chip delivers insanely great performance.design and buildsince its inception, macbook airs design and build were one of its core selling points, and the macbook air m1 is no exception. it has that signature aluminium body that youll see with the other macbook variants. the laptop not only looks premium but it definitely feels like your moneys worth. you can easily open this laptop with only one finger, this is possible because of the incredibly engineered hinge design done by apple. one of the things that the original macbook air lacked for a while was a decent display, gone are the days of a 720p panel. and brought is a beautiful p3 wide color gamut 2560*1440p panel, the overall viewing experience is awesome! the bezels are the same size as last year's model, which was kinda disappointing when compared to other laptops recently released, but it's not something that will ruin the overall viewing experience. the updated magic keyboard has better travel and also the gigantic mouse pad is always a blessing, im yet to find a trackpad on a laptop that i like better than the ones made by apple. the dual speaker grills on this laptop produce pretty decent sound, however, there is some slight distortion at high volumes.storagestorage is also very important as a college student. as you're going to need some space to store all your documents, files, and zoom lectures. the macbook air comes with up to 2tb of ssd storage. this specific model i have only had 128gb of storage which honestly should be fine for most students, and if you dont want to spend a lot of money you can always buy an external ssd or hard drive. this will cost you way less than what apple offers.portabilityas a college student in 2021, because of covid, it's been kinda different, (very small pause)all of our classes nowadays are held on zoom or some other online platform. so if you wanna use this laptop outside of a typical campus setting, then portability starts to matter. the macbook air weighs in at 2.75 pounds and is 15.6mm thick. this laptop will easily fit in most backups without feeling a noticeable weight difference. this is important to a lot of students, especially if you have back-to-back classes keeping in mind the average textbook weighs just over 4.6 pounds. this laptop also easily fits in most handbags for women who were wondering.reliability and batterythe apple macbook air has proven itself as one of the most reliable laptops for a student this past decade. the macbook air is going to be a more compelling laptop for the students this, because of its insanely reliable performance for its price, but let's talk about the chip thats made all this possible.the biggest change this year is no doubt the m1 chip, the arm-based chip is fast,  like stupid fast. applications open up real quick and the performance is consistently reliable. not only can it easily fly through day-to-day tasks like browsing the internet and typing research papers, but it can also handle intensive tasks such as 4k video editing, in fact, i managed to edit an entire 4k video on the m1 macbook air and the performance & exporting times were very impressive. anyway, that was sometimes impossible on the previous-gens of macbook air. now if you are considering this device for video editing then i would highly recommend the 16 gig variant.the next best thing aside from its insane performance is the incredible battery life, i think this is the best battery life i have ever seen on a laptop of this form factor. the laptop lasted me multiple days of light usage with the usual workload being typing, browsing, and streaming content. i can pull a full day of heavy usage with tasks like editing photos and videos.conclusionoverall theres a quote that says, speed is irrelevant if you are going in the wrong direction. (mahatma gandhi). the macbook air m1 has set a new benchmark for consistent performance and delivers insanely awesome battery life which makes the overall experience pretty fire. its portability, reliability, and speed not only make this a great investment for a student but also for anybody whos always on the go, and im personally really excited for the direction that apple is heading towards with their new m lineup of processers.\n",

      "Review: (heads-up, this review will be lengthy, but i wanted to cover every aspect to make sure you make the right buying choice).the macbook air has always been known as a popular choice for college students over the years due to the lightweight, slim design and good battery life. one caveat that has always plagued the macbook air of years past was underwhelming performance due to underclocked, lower-powered processors (which were always reserved for the pro line). that was why i always got a macbook pro in years past. this time around, when apple announced the new m1 chip, i was curious, so i watched hours and hours of reviews and decided to pull the trigger on the new air (the air has the same chipset as the macbook pro, with the same ghz at 3.2, while saving $300). i am on a budget, but i also didnt want to sacrifice performance, so i was a little nervous i was missing out by not getting the pro, but thankfully i have not had to sacrifice a thing.i am a full-time digital design student, so my workflow can be demanding at times with running adobe photoshop and adobe indesign, etc. i previously purchased a 2017 macbook pro and it was my daily driver until about mid-march when i made a grievous error and went out and purchased a lenovo yoga c940 with 16gb of ram, intel i7 processor at a whopping price tag of $1500.00. buyers remorse soon followed as the yoga was plagued with overheating issues, thermal throttling and absolutely horrific battery life. the only thing that i liked was the speaker set-up and the 4k touch screen. other than that, i was beyond disappointed. i sent it back, and went back to using my 2017 macbook pro, until i purchased this air.so the pros:fantastic battery lifei have a tough time killing the battery on this computer. it will easily last an entire day, and even longer if you arent totally hammering this thing with demanding apps like i do. its great to know you dont have to always carry a charger with you everywhere (you can carry from class to class, the coffee shop and back home and itll still have battery to spare). a win in my book.heat management and fanless designi am super nit-picky about heat management and fan noise when it comes to laptops, which is why i always love the macbooks and detest windows (hence sending the lenovo back).  the fact that this computer is fanless and manages to stay cool to the touch boggles my mind. i dont have to worry about a computer than will get so hot that you can fry an egg on it, or annoying fans kicking on. i also like that i dont have to worry about blocking any ventilation grills, since there is no fan. i can sit in bed with covers under this and not worry im blocking a fan exhaust.  again, another win in my book.slim designat 2.8 pounds, and having a tapered design, you can throw this thing in a backpack and not feel like youre lugging around a brick. i also liked the tapered design as its a little more ergonomic than my macbook pro that has some really sharp edges by the trackpad. its a nice change for someone that has to type up essays all of the time.keyboardgone are the butterfly mechanisms of macbooks past. one thing i really missed when i gave up my 2015 macbook pro was the keyboard! thankfully with the new air and pros, you get the scissor switch mechanisms back, so my fingers dont feel like theyre hitting bottom when typing for long periods of time.trackpadi love, love the force touch trackpad. i still believe apple has one of the best trackpad designs of any laptop out there. hands down. its smooth as butter.performancethis is the little machine that could. it puts my 2017 pro to shame. it also outperforms the lenovo that was supposed to be top of the line, at a fraction of the cost. i can have multiple tabs in safari open, photoshop, apple music, microsoft word, and this doesnt even break a sweat. i also like that i can do some light video editing on this. for most peopleespecially college studentsthis computers power should be more than sufficient. keep in mind if you are a professional videographer or photographer, you might want to opt for the pro as it does have a fan and can sustain heat management better in terms of thermal throttling. again, thats if youre editing like multiple 4k videos on a daily basis, but for college students or the average joe that may only need to do the occasional video projectno problem! this computer can handle it!screenits nice and bright, and the color accuracy is on point, which is important if you edit photos or videos in any capacity like i do.speakersi am a music junkie, and i have to constantly have music going when im working on school projects, and for such a thin and light laptop the speakers on this are actually pretty good. good stereo separation and punchy. they could do with a little more bass, and when you max the volume it can get a little faded, but thats to be expected for such small speaker drivers. i am more than pleased with them. they also work good for binge-watching shows on netflix.the cons (there are few):the webcamits a 720p webcam, and well, it looks like a 720p webcam. its a little grainy and washed out. it will do in a pinch, but youd think in 2020 wed get an upgrade on the webcam.the lack of portsin true apple fashion, the i/o is somewhat lacking. you have 2 thunderbolt 4 ports, of which you cannot plug in an external gpu, and are limited to one external monitor (this is a limit that apples m1 system on a chip, not the thunderbolt ports, which i am sure will be resolved in future iterations). i would have liked to have seen at least one usb-a port for legacy things like flash drives, etc. but thats just me being nit-picky.m1 chip running intel appsbecause apples m1 chip runs on arm and most apps are coded for intel, there are many apps that have not been optimized to run the new apple chip natively (like adobe creative cloud). you might run into a few glitches and hick-ups while app developers are getting up to speed. so far, i havent really run into any issues, but there is that possibility. i am sure here soon it wont be a problem. again, its nit-picking.--to sum up: this macbook air is a winner. i would absolutely not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, and i would absolutely buy it again. you get the performance and the portability, while saving some $ by not buying the pro line. i am very happy with this computer and think i might just have come as close as i can to the perfect laptop for my needs.happy shopping!\n",

      "Review: i was hesitant to get a smaller macbook after my 15\" 2015 macbook pro started to suffer from keyboard issues.  i repaired the keyboard twice, so there must have been something wrong with voltage regulation to it.anyhow, i couldn't resist the idea of an arm based macbook, so i went with the 2020 13\" macbook air since i don't think the pro model had apple silicon yet.  i could be wrong on that.long story short, it meets all my needs with flying colors!  it turns out that i'm perfectly comfortable with a 13\" screen and that i don't need a bigger one.everything great about this macbook:- it's *fast*!  don't let the \"air\" moniker deceive you.  unless you're into heavy gaming, this is the laptop for you.  arm processors are the future of consumer computing.- the battery life is *insane*.  i still can't comprehend how many hours this thing survives unplugged.  i take it on flights across the country and never need to plug in or get worried that i will run out of power, even when i'm charging my phone off it!- it's slim and light!  perfect for traveling.- it is completely solid state with no moving parts!  no fan whirring or anything like that.- as an extension of the first point, it runs arm builds of windows insanely well with parallels.  it can even run halo: ce at near full speed!- macos is very stable.- the retina screen is nice.- despite what people are saying about the camera, it's actually better than the one on my old macbook pro.  (this isn't to say that the camera is *good*, but it's adequate imo)- all things considered, the m1 macbook air is incredible value and really a great deal for the price.- it has a larger touchpad than my old macbook pro but not quite as bit as the one on current 13\" macbook pros.  i find this preferable because it is just the right size where i'm not constantly hitting it with my palm as i type.  if you type a lot then the touchpad on this laptop will probably annoy you less while still having plenty of surface area.- no touchbar!!!  halleluja!!!!- decent sound from the speakers considering the size constraint.there are some cons, but they are pretty minor imo:- only the left side has usb-c ports, in contrast to the pro which has them on both sides.  the right side *does* have an analog audio jack, however, if that's useful to you.  however, i've managed fine without usb on the right side.- it would be nice if i didn't have to click the fingerprint sensor button to get it to sense my finger and wake the system.  on pros, the fingerprint sensor is always active.- if you are one of the 3 people on the planet who want the touchbar, this will not have it. (i however consider this a good thing)- although the speakers have improved in quality since previous air models, the pro is still going to have better sounding speakers.  you may feel like you've gotten a bit of a downgrade in that regard if you are coming from a pro model.  personally, i've gotten used to it plus i use airpods most of the time anyway.- the air does not have an hdmi port, but you can buy an (expensive) adapter that will provide hdmi.- storage capacity is workable but limited.  would be nice to get at least 1 tb of storage in the future.  in the meantime i just back stuff up on to an external drive and periodically clear my downloads folder.i'm a software engineer and the m1 macbook air exceeds my needs and expectations.  i think i'll just be buying the air model in the future because it's terrific value for the price point.  $999 might be expensive for some, but i can assure you that it's a robust laptop so you are saving money in the long run.  i've owned many non-apple laptops in the past and i ended up hating all of them.  on the other hand, i never regret owning an apple device.  this is coming from someone who formerly used windows and linux.  i got tired of both the hardware and software breaking down quickly.  apple isn't perfect... my last macbook pro chugged along for over 6 years until the keyboard repeatedly failed, but that still beats all previous laptops i owned that had numerous problems unrelated to how i treated them.\n",

      "Review: omg! this is such an incredible product. perfect keyboard, perfect weight, perfect battery life, perfect trackpad, perfect performance, perfect touch id, perfect feel, perfect build, perfect look, perfect size, perfect stereo sound, perfect screen, perfect noise absence as not having a fan! i mean, it doesn't have a fan and it doesn't get hot most of the times. wtf?! it's the only laptop i've been able to use in my bed for x amount of hours and it is sooo comfortable to do it. it truly is one of the best products out there and it is totally worth the investment, because that's how i see it, not even as spending, that's just how good it is. i'm enthusiastic because this is for sure the best device apple has created in terms of price/what you get, and it will probably stay in that position for a couple of years. this is game-changing and revolutionary. the computer feels as if it will last 10+ years, honestly. i highly recommend it. btw, it is so good my girlfriend decided to get one for herself because she just couldn't get over the first time she used it, and just how beautiful it is and pleasurable to look at from any perspective... this laptop is so ridiculously perfect that you can even open it with one hand and in just a couple of seconds, you will be ready to use it as it has an always-on feature that allows you to get down to the working right away. that is probably the best feat. true tone is also really good, as it is automatic brightness adjustment and dark mode, they sit together perfectly well. get it! you won't regret it at any moment. truly a high-end experience. oh, and... it looks elegant at any angle, and which is most important, classy it feels.\n",

      "Review: not much to say, excellent product overall. no cons except lack of ports. all day+ battery life, excellent screen. keyboard is good as well. i have the 8 gb ram version but haven't seen any lag due to it. use it often to run demanding simulations and it has not disappointed me so far.i was little concerned with the m1 chip and compatibility. however, x86-64 runs well enough, though cpu/ram usage is a bit higher (dropbox, for example). if you are using native versions, its far better than any x86-64 mobile cpus on market.\n",
